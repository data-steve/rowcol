# Executable Tasks - Critical Development Blockers

*Consolidated from backlog analysis on 2025-01-27*  
*Status: ‚úÖ READY FOR HANDS-FREE EXECUTION*

## **Task Complexity Curation**

**‚úÖ FULLY SOLVED (6 tasks)** - These tasks have:
- Clear implementation patterns with code examples
- Specific files to fix with exact changes needed
- Complete verification steps with pytest commands
- No "figure out" or "analyze" language
- Ready for execution by any developer

---

## **CRITICAL: Read These Files First**

Before starting any executable tasks, you MUST read these files to understand the system:

### **Architecture Context:**
- `docs/architecture/COMPREHENSIVE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system architecture
- `docs/build_plan_v5.md` - Current build plan and phase context
- `docs/architecture/ADR-001-domains-runway-separation.md` - Domain separation principles
- `docs/architecture/ADR-005-qbo-api-strategy.md` - QBO integration strategy
- `docs/architecture/ADR-003-multi-tenancy-strategy.md` - Multi-tenancy patterns

## **Context for All Tasks**

**IMPORTANT**: These are critical development blockers that prevent real data implementation and core functionality. They should be completed before moving to new product features.

### **Post-Nuclear Cleanup Context**
- Clean architecture: `Domain Service ‚Üí SmartSyncService ‚Üí Raw QBO HTTP Calls`
- No circular dependencies
- Integration model simplified (QBO fields in Business model)
- SmartSync test patterns established
- Database connection fixtures created

### **Critical Success Factors**
- All tasks must align with post-nuclear architecture
- Use new SmartSync patterns and database fixtures
- Address mock violations documented in 008_eliminate_remaining_mock_violations.md
- Solutions must be documented as executable tasks

## **Phase 1: Data Orchestrator Pattern Implementation (P0 Critical)**

#### **Task 1: Implement Data Orchestrator Pattern for Tray and Console**
- **Status:** `[ ]` Not started
- **Priority:** P0 Critical
- **Justification:** Establish the architectural foundation for experience services using data orchestrators. Implement Tray (simple) and Console (with state management) to establish the pattern for all other experiences.
- **Files to Fix:**
  - `runway/core/runway_calculator.py` - Refactor to pure calculation service
  - `runway/experiences/tray.py` - Use HygieneTrayDataOrchestrator
  - `runway/experiences/console.py` - Use DecisionConsoleDataOrchestrator
- **Required Changes:**
  - Create `runway/core/data_orchestrators/` directory
  - Implement `HygieneTrayDataOrchestrator` (simple data pulling)
  - Implement `DecisionConsoleDataOrchestrator` (data + state management)
  - Refactor RunwayCalculator to pure calculation service
  - Update Tray and Console services to use orchestrators
  - Remove direct SmartSyncService calls from Tray and Console
- **Pattern to Implement:**
  ```python
  # Tray Orchestrator (Simple)
  class HygieneTrayDataOrchestrator:
      async def get_tray_data(self, business_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
          bills = await self.ap_service.get_bills_with_issues(business_id)
          invoices = await self.ar_service.get_invoices_with_issues(business_id)
          return {"bills": bills, "invoices": invoices}
  
  # Console Orchestrator (With State Management)
  class DecisionConsoleDataOrchestrator:
      async def get_console_data(self, business_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
          bills = await self.ap_service.get_bills_ready_for_decision(business_id)
          invoices = await self.ar_service.get_invoices_ready_for_decision(business_id)
          balances = await self.bank_service.get_balances(business_id)
          decision_queue = await self._get_decision_queue(business_id)
          return {"bills": bills, "invoices": invoices, "balances": balances, "decision_queue": decision_queue}
      
      async def add_decision(self, business_id: str, decision: Dict) -> Dict:
          await self._store_decision(business_id, decision)
          return await self.get_console_data(business_id)
  
  # Update experience services
  class HygieneTrayService:
      def __init__(self, db: Session):
          self.db = db
          self.orchestrator = HygieneTrayDataOrchestrator()
      
      async def get_tray_items(self, business_id: str) -> List[Dict]:
          data = await self.orchestrator.get_tray_data(business_id)
          return data["bills"] + data["invoices"]
  
  class DecisionConsoleService:
      def __init__(self, db: Session):
          self.db = db
          self.orchestrator = DecisionConsoleDataOrchestrator()
      
      async def get_console_data(self, business_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
          return await self.orchestrator.get_console_data(business_id)
      
      async def add_decision(self, business_id: str, decision: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
          return await self.orchestrator.add_decision(business_id, decision)
  ```

## **Phase 2: Mock Violations & Real Data Implementation (P0 Critical)**

#### **Task 2: Eliminate Mock Violations in Experience Services**
- **Status:** `[ ]` Not started
- **Priority:** P0 Critical
- **Justification:** Experience services still have hardcoded mock data that violates our "no more mocks" commitment. This prevents real data implementation and testing.

  - Implement proper error handling for missing QBO data
- **Pattern to Implement:**
  ```python
  # Instead of: mock_qbo_data = {"bills": [], "invoices": []}
  # Use: 
  from infra.qbo.smart_sync import SmartSyncService
  smart_sync = SmartSyncService(business_id)
  bills = await smart_sync.get_bills()
  invoices = await smart_sync.get_invoices()
  ```
- **Dependencies:** None

  - Run cleanup verification commands

---

#### **Task 2: Implement Real Data in Tray Experience**
- **Status:** `[ ]` Not started
- **Priority:** P0 Critical
- **Justification:** `runway/experiences/tray.py` returns empty lists instead of real data. This is a core user-facing feature that needs real data.
- **Files to Fix:**
  - `runway/experiences/tray.py` - Connect to real domain services
  - `runway/experiences/digest.py` - Connect to real domain services
- **Required Changes:**
  - Connect tray experience to real domain services
  - Use SmartSyncService for QBO data
  - Implement proper data transformation from domain models to experience format

  ```python
  # Instead of: return []
  # Use:
  from domains.ap.services.bill_service import BillService
  from domains.ar.services.invoice_service import InvoiceService
  
  bill_service = BillService(business_id)
  invoice_service = InvoiceService(business_id)
  
  bills = await bill_service.get_bills()
  invoices = await invoice_service.get_invoices()
  
  return transform_to_tray_format(bills, invoices)
  ```
- **Dependencies:** `Eliminate Mock Violations in Experience Services`
- **Verification:**

#### **Task 3: Create Comprehensive Test Data Service**

- **Files to Create:**
  - `infra/qbo/test_data_service.py` - Centralized test data service
  - `tests/fixtures/qbo_data.py` - QBO data fixtures
- **Required Implementation:**
  ```python
  class QBOTestDataService:
      def __init__(self, business_id: str):
          self.smart_sync = SmartSyncService(business_id)
      
      async def get_test_bills(self) -> List[Dict]:
          """Get real QBO sandbox bills for testing."""
          return await self.smart_sync.get_bills()
      
      async def get_test_invoices(self) -> List[Dict]:
          """Get real QBO sandbox invoices for testing."""
          return await self.smart_sync.get_invoices()
      
      def create_mock_business(self) -> Business:
          """Create test business with QBO fields."""
          # Implementation here
  ```
- **Dependencies:** `Implement Real Data in Tray Experience`
- **Verification:**

  - Remove over-engineered dependency injection containers
- **Pattern to Implement:**
  ```python

  def get_services(business_id: str = Depends(get_current_business_id)):
      return {"bill_service": BillService(business_id), ...}
  
  # Use:
  @router.get("/bills")
  async def get_bills(business_id: str = Depends(get_current_business_id)):

- **P1 High:** 1 task (dependency injection refactoring)
- **Completed:** 0 tasks
- **Remaining:** 5 tasks

**Key Success Patterns:**
- Use SmartSyncService for all QBO operations
- Use database fixtures from tests/conftest.py

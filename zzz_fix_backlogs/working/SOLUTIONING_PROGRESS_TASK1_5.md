# Solutioning Progress - Task 1.5: Consolidate Priority Logic and Clarify Domain Service Boundaries

*Status: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Architectural Analysis Required*

## **Problem Statement**

The implementation of ADR-006 revealed massive architectural inconsistencies that must be addressed before Task 1 can be considered truly executable:

1. **Priority calculation logic scattered across 5+ services** with conflicting implementations
2. **Domain service duplication and overlap** creating confusion about responsibilities  
3. **RunwayCalculator scope creep** violating ADR-001 principles
4. **QBO data mapping inconsistency** between domains/ and runway/ naming conventions
5. **Missing integration** between experiences and runway/core services

## **Architecture Decisions Required**

### **1. Priority Calculation Consolidation**

**Decision**: Move ALL priority calculation logic to `runway/core/priority_calculation_service.py`

**Rationale**: 
- Single source of truth for all priority calculations
- Eliminates "rabbit droppings" of duplicate logic
- Centralizes business rules for consistency
- Maintains ADR-001 separation (domains/ = data, runway/ = business logic)

**Implementation**:
```python
# runway/core/priority_calculation_service.py
class PriorityCalculationService:
    def calculate_bill_priority_score(self, bill_data: Dict) -> float
    def calculate_invoice_priority_score(self, invoice_data: Dict) -> float
    def calculate_tray_item_priority(self, item_data: Dict) -> Dict
    def calculate_collection_priority_score(self, customer_data: Dict) -> float
```

**Remove from**:
- `domains/ap/services/bill_ingestion.py:297` - `calculate_bill_priority()`
- `domains/ar/services/customer.py:62` - `calculate_collection_priority_score()`
- `runway/core/payment_priority_calculator.py:38` - `calculate_bill_priority_score()`
- `runway/core/tray_priority_calculator.py:39` - `calculate_tray_item_priority()`

### **2. Domain Service Consolidation**

#### **AP Services Consolidation**
**Decision**: Merge `ap_ingestion.py` into `bill_ingestion.py` and rename to `bill_service.py`

**Rationale**:
- `ap_ingestion.py` is just a wrapper around `bill_ingestion.py`
- `bill_ingestion.py` already has comprehensive bill lifecycle management
- Single canonical service for all bill operations

**Implementation**:
- Keep `BillService` as the canonical AP service
- Remove `IngestionService` from `ap_ingestion.py`
- Update all imports to use `BillService`

#### **AR Services Consolidation**
**Decision**: Clarify boundaries between AR services

**Current Services**:
- `InvoiceService` - Basic invoice CRUD operations
- `CollectionsService` - Overdue invoice tracking and reminders
- `ARPlanService` - AR planning and forecasting
- `CustomerService` - Customer management and priority scoring
- `PaymentApplicationService` - Payment application to invoices
- `PaymentMatchingService` - Payment matching and reconciliation

**Proposed Boundaries**:
- **`InvoiceService`** - Invoice CRUD, basic queries
- **`CollectionsService`** - Overdue tracking, reminder sending, aging analysis
- **`CustomerService`** - Customer management, payment history, reliability scoring
- **`PaymentMatchingService`** - Payment application + matching (merge the two)
- **`ARPlanService`** - Move to `runway/core/` as it's product-specific

#### **Payment Services Consolidation**
**Decision**: Merge `PaymentApplicationService` into `PaymentMatchingService`

**Rationale**:
- Payment application and matching are closely related
- Reduces service complexity
- Single service for all payment-related operations

### **3. QBO Data Mapping Strategy**

**Decision**: Create consistent data mapping layer in `runway/core/data_mappers/`

**Problem**: QBO field names vs runway field names create confusion
- QBO: `TotalAmt`, `DueDate`, `VendorRef`
- Runway: `amount`, `due_date`, `vendor_name`

**Solution**: Create mapper services that handle QBO â†’ Runway field mapping

**Implementation**:
```python
# runway/core/data_mappers/qbo_mapper.py
class QBOMapper:
    def map_bill_data(self, qbo_bill: Dict) -> Dict:
        return {
            'amount': qbo_bill.get('TotalAmt', 0),
            'due_date': qbo_bill.get('DueDate'),
            'vendor_name': qbo_bill.get('VendorRef', {}).get('name'),
            'qbo_id': qbo_bill.get('Id'),
            # ... other mappings
        }
    
    def map_invoice_data(self, qbo_invoice: Dict) -> Dict:
        # Similar mapping for invoices
        pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Single place for QBO field mapping
- Consistent naming across runway services
- Easy to maintain when QBO API changes
- Clear separation between QBO data and runway data

### **4. RunwayCalculator Refactoring**

**Decision**: Split RunwayCalculator into focused services

**Current Issues**:
- Monolithic service doing too much
- Entity-specific calculations mixed with runway calculations
- Violates ADR-001 by doing domain-specific work

**Proposed Split**:
```python
# runway/core/runway_calculation_service.py - Pure runway calculations
class RunwayCalculationService:
    def calculate_current_runway(self, qbo_data: Dict) -> Dict
    def calculate_scenario_impact(self, scenario: Dict, qbo_data: Dict) -> Dict
    def calculate_historical_runway(self, qbo_data: Dict) -> List[Dict]

# runway/core/bill_impact_calculator.py - Bill-specific calculations  
class BillImpactCalculator:
    def calculate_bill_runway_impact(self, bill_data: Dict) -> Dict
    def calculate_payment_impact(self, payment_data: Dict) -> Dict

# runway/core/tray_impact_calculator.py - Tray-specific calculations
class TrayImpactCalculator:
    def calculate_tray_item_runway_impact(self, item_data: Dict) -> Dict
    def calculate_hygiene_impact(self, hygiene_data: Dict) -> Dict
```

### **5. Balance Service Relocation**

**Decision**: Move `domains/core/services/balance_service.py` to `domains/bank/services/balance_service.py`

**Rationale**:
- Balances are bank account data, not core business data
- Aligns with domain organization principles
- Reduces confusion about service location

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Priority Logic Consolidation**

4. Update all imports and references

### **Phase 3: QBO Data Mapping**
1. Create `runway/core/data_mappers/` directory
2. Implement `QBOMapper` for consistent field mapping
3. Update data orchestrators to use mappers
4. Ensure consistent naming across runway services

### **Phase 4: RunwayCalculator Refactoring**
1. Split RunwayCalculator into focused services
2. Move entity-specific calculations to appropriate calculators
3. Keep only pure runway calculations in RunwayCalculationService
4. Update all references to use new service structure

### **Phase 5: Balance Service Relocation**

### **ðŸ”„ REMAINING WORK (Next Thread)**
1. **Priority Logic Consolidation** - **NEEDS SOLUTIONING** - Requires analysis and design
2. **QBO Data Mapping Strategy** - **NEEDS SOLUTIONING** - Requires analysis and design
3. **RunwayCalculator Refactoring** - **NEEDS SOLUTIONING** - Requires analysis and design (Task 1.2)

## **SOLUTIONING WORK REQUIRED**

### **Critical Issue Identified**
The previous analysis was premature and created executable tasks without proper solutioning work. The RunwayCalculator refactoring is the **foundation** that needs to be designed first, as it will determine how priority scoring and other calculations should be organized.

### **Next Steps for Next Thread**

1. **Start with Task 1.2** - Design RunwayCalculator Service Architecture (foundation task)
2. **Complete Priority Logic Solutioning** - After understanding the service architecture
3. **Complete QBO Data Mapping Solutioning** - After understanding data flow patterns
4. **Create executable tasks** only after solutioning is complete
5. **Validate** that all experiences work correctly with new architecture

### **Key Insight**
RunwayCalculator refactoring is the architectural foundation that will determine:
- How priority scoring integrates with runway calculations
- How entity-specific calculations (bills, invoices, collections) should be organized
- What the proper service boundaries should be
- How different calculation types (scenario, historical, current) should work together

This must be designed first before any other consolidation work can be properly planned.

## **Thread Handoff Notes**

- **Server Status**: âœ… Working (import errors fixed)
- **Completed**: Domain service consolidation (AP, AR, Balance)
- **Next Priority**: Priority logic consolidation (solutioning phase)
- **Key Files**: All domain service consolidation complete, ready for priority logic design

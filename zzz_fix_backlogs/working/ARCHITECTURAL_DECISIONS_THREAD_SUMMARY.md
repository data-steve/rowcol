# Architectural Decisions - Thread Summary

*Thread: feat/infra-consolidation - Payment Service Architecture and Mock Elimination*

## **Critical Issues Resolved**

### **1. Fake Status Updates Eliminated**
**Problem**: Multiple services were updating database status without performing actual work
**Solution**: Replaced all fake status updates with `NotImplementedError` and proper TODO documentation

**Files Fixed:**
- `domains/ar/services/adjustment.py` - Credit memo approval workflow
- `domains/ar/services/customer.py` - Customer credit status assessment
- `runway/core/ar_plan_service.py` - Deleted (duplicate of collections.py)
- `domains/ar/services/collections.py` - AR collections reminder functionality

### **2. Service Consolidation Completed**
**Problem**: Duplicate payment logic between BillIngestionService and PaymentService
**Solution**: Consolidated all payment operations into PaymentService as single source of truth

**Architecture:**
- **BillService**: Bill ingestion and QBO sync only
- **PaymentService**: All payment operations (execution, records, QBO integration)
- **ScheduledPaymentService**: Single bill scheduling + runway reserve integration

### **3. ADR-001 Violations Fixed**
**Problem**: PaymentService was importing ScheduledPaymentService from runway/ (violates ADR-001)
**Solution**: Removed competing `schedule_payment()` method from PaymentService

**Service Boundaries:**
- **Domains/**: Domain operations only (bills, payments, invoices)
- **Runway/**: Runway decisions and orchestration (scheduling, reserves, console)

## **Current Service Architecture**

### **Payment Workflow Services:**
1. **PaymentService** (`domains/ap/services/payment.py`)
   - Single payment execution
   - Payment record creation and management
   - QBO payment integration
   - Payment status tracking

2. **ScheduledPaymentService** (`runway/core/scheduled_payment_service.py`)
   - Single bill scheduling with runway reserve integration
   - Reserve allocation (earmarking money)
   - QBO scheduled payment creation
   - Reserve lifecycle management

3. **ConsoleService** (`runway/experiences/console.py`) - **TO BE IMPLEMENTED**
   - Multi-bill payment orchestration
   - Batch finalization for "Pay Now", "Schedule", "Delay"
   - Decision queue management

### **Bill Workflow Services:**
1. **BillService** (`domains/ap/services/bill_ingestion.py`)
   - Bill ingestion from QBO and documents
   - Bill approval workflow
   - QBO synchronization
   - **NO payment logic** (delegates to PaymentService)

2. **VendorService** (`domains/ap/services/vendor.py`)
   - Centralized vendor operations
   - Vendor lookup and creation
   - Vendor payment methods

## **Key Architectural Principles Established**

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each service has one clear purpose
- No mixing of domain operations with runway decisions
- Clear separation between data operations and business logic

### **2. ADR-001 Compliance**
- Domains/ services never depend on runway/ services
- Runway/ services can depend on domains/ services
- Clean dependency flow: Experience → Runway → Domain

### **3. Fail-Fast Approach**
- TODOs raise `NotImplementedError` instead of returning fake data
- Clear error messages pointing to build plan for implementation
- No misleading status updates that don't correspond to real work

### **4. Service Delegation Pattern**
- BillService delegates payment operations to PaymentService
- ConsoleService will orchestrate multi-bill payments using both services
- Clear interfaces between services

## **Remaining Work (Task 4 - Solutioning Required)**

### **Console Payment Decision Workflow**
**Status**: Added to `002_NEEDS_SOLVING_TASKS.md` as Task 4
**Complexity**: Requires careful analysis and design

**Key Questions to Solve:**
1. **Bill Approval → Staging**: When should reserves be allocated?
2. **Decision Queue**: How should "Pay Now" vs "Schedule" vs "Delay" be handled?
3. **Batch Finalization**: How should ConsoleService orchestrate multi-bill payments?
4. **Reserve Management**: How do "Delay" decisions affect reserve allocation?

**Discovery Commands Provided:**
- Comprehensive grep patterns to find all payment workflow components
- Clear analysis requirements and verification criteria

## **Files Modified in This Thread**

### **Critical Fixes:**
- `domains/ap/services/payment.py` - Removed ADR-001 violation, consolidated payment logic
- `domains/ap/services/bill_ingestion.py` - Removed payment logic, added vendor delegation
- `domains/ar/services/adjustment.py` - Replaced fake approval with NotImplementedError
- `domains/ar/services/customer.py` - Replaced fake credit check with NotImplementedError
- `domains/ar/services/collections.py` - Replaced fake reminder with NotImplementedError
- `runway/core/ar_plan_service.py` - Deleted (duplicate)

### **New Services Created:**
- `domains/ap/services/vendor.py` - Centralized vendor operations
- `infra/qbo/utils.py` - Centralized QBO utility functions
- `runway/core/scheduled_payment_service.py` - Runway-aware payment scheduling

### **Documentation Updated:**
- `002_NEEDS_SOLVING_TASKS.md` - Added Task 4 for console payment workflow design

## **Next Steps**

1. **Complete Task 4 Solutioning** - Design console payment decision workflow
2. **Implement ConsoleService** - Multi-bill orchestration and batch finalization
3. **Test Integration** - Ensure all services work together properly
4. **Update Tests** - Fix any tests that were broken by architectural changes

## **Thread Status: READY FOR CLOSE**

**All critical architectural issues have been resolved:**
- ✅ Fake status updates eliminated
- ✅ Service consolidation completed
- ✅ ADR-001 violations fixed
- ✅ Service boundaries clarified
- ✅ Remaining work properly documented as solutioning task

**The codebase is now architecturally sound and ready for the next phase of development.**

# Needs Solving Tasks - SmartSync & QBO Architecture Cleanup

*Generated from infrastructure consolidation cleanup on 2025-01-27*  
*Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ANALYSIS AND SOLUTION WORK*

## **Task Complexity Curation**

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS SOLUTION WORK (8 tasks)** - These tasks require:
- Analysis and discovery work
- "Figure out" or "determine" language present
- Dependencies on other solution tasks
- Architectural decisions that need human input
- Cannot be executed without solution phase

---

## **Context for All Tasks**

**IMPORTANT**: Before starting any solutioning work, read `LAUNCH_SOLUTIONING_TASKS.md` twice. It contains the complete solutioning framework and methodology you must follow.

### **What is zzz_fix_backlogs?**
This directory contains cleanup tasks from a major infrastructure consolidation effort. The codebase was refactored to move scattered utilities into a consolidated `infra/jobs/` directory, but several architectural decisions need analysis and solution work before they can be executed.

### **Current Architecture State**
- **SmartSyncService** (`infra/jobs/smart_sync.py`): Central orchestration layer for ALL QBO interactions. Handles retries, deduplication, rate limiting, and caching while enabling immediate user actions through direct API calls. See [ADR-005: QBO API Strategy](../docs/architecture/ADR-005-qbo-api-strategy.md) for complete architecture.
- **QBOBulkScheduledService** (`domains/qbo/service.py`): ONLY for bulk background data operations (like digest generation). NOT for user actions.
- **Direct QBO API calls** (`domains/qbo/client.py`): For immediate user actions (pay bill, delay payment, send collection). Must be wrapped in SmartSyncService for fragility handling.
- **QBODataService** (`domains/qbo/data_service.py`): ONLY for `runway/experiences/` data formatting. NOT a generic data fetcher.
- **User Actions vs Data Syncs**: User actions = immediate QBO API calls wrapped in SmartSyncService. Data syncs = background operations coordinated by SmartSyncService.

### **Key Architecture Principle**
The question isn't "SmartSyncService vs direct API calls" - it's "How do we use SmartSyncService to handle QBO's fragility while maintaining the UX of immediate user actions?" Answer: SmartSyncService as the orchestration layer that handles retries, deduplication, rate limiting, and caching, while still allowing direct API calls for user actions.

### **QBO Fragility Context**
QuickBooks Online API has well-documented fragility that can disrupt the cash runway ritual:
- **Rate Limiting**: 500 requests/min per app, 100 requests/sec per realm
- **Intermittent Failures**: 503 Service Unavailable, network latency, maintenance windows
- **Duplicate Actions**: Retrying failed requests can create duplicate transactions
- **Lost Actions**: QBO's async processing can make actions appear to fail when they succeeded
- **Data Inconsistencies**: QBO data may not reflect real-time changes
- **Webhook Reliability**: Missed events, out-of-order delivery, duplicates

### **Product Context**
Oodaloo is a cash runway management tool for service agencies ($1M‚Äì$5M, 10-30 staff) that automates 70-80% of weekly cash runway decisions through QBO integration. The core value proposition is the "weekly cash runway ritual" - a seamless, trustworthy experience where users can make immediate decisions (pay bills, send reminders) with real-time feedback.

**Key Challenge**: These tasks require understanding complex relationships and making architectural decisions that affect multiple parts of the system.

## **Development Environment Setup**

**IMPORTANT**: Start your development session with:
```bash
cd ~/projects/oodaloo
poetry shell
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
This activates the virtual environment and starts the application once. Keep uvicorn running in the background throughout your analysis work.

## **Phase 1: Data Architecture Problems (P1 High)**

#### **Task 2: Fix Calculator ‚Üí Experience Data Flow**
- **Status:** `[ ]` Not started
- **Priority:** P1 High
- **Justification:** Each calculator in `runway/core/` should feed its specific `runway/experiences/` with the right data for their goals. Current data flow is broken or inconsistent, causing experiences to show wrong or missing data.

#### **Task 3: Clean Up Experience Services Data Patterns**
- **Status:** `[ ]` Not started

#### **Task 4: Fix Digest Data Architecture - Replace Wrong `get_qbo_data_for_digest` Pattern**
- **Status:** `[ ]` Not started
- **Priority:** P1 High
- **Justification:** Digest is using the wrong data pattern (`get_qbo_data_for_digest`) instead of proper bulk operations. Digest needs to pull across lots of entities and run calculators for all customers on Friday morning jobs - this requires bulk operations on 2 dimensions, not generic data fetching. The `get_qbo_data_for_digest` pattern was decided against because it's a singular solution for every experience when each experience should get data from its specific calculator.
- **Code Pointers:**
  - `runway/experiences/digest.py` - Currently uses wrong `get_qbo_data_for_digest` pattern
  - `domains/qbo/data_service.py` - Contains `get_qbo_data_for_digest` methods that need removal
  - `domains/qbo/service.py` - QBOBulkScheduledService for proper bulk operations
  - `infra/jobs/smart_sync.py` - SmartSync orchestration for bulk operations
- **Current Issues to Resolve:**
  - Digest uses `get_qbo_data_for_digest` which is the wrong pattern
  - Need proper bulk operations that pull across lots of entities for all customers
  - Friday morning jobs need coordinated bulk data fetching, not individual data calls
  - `get_qbo_data_for_digest` pattern exists throughout domains and needs removal
- **Required Analysis:**
  - Analyze current `get_qbo_data_for_digest` usage across all files
  - Design proper bulk operations architecture for digest
  - Determine how digest should pull across lots of entities for all customers
  - Design Friday morning job coordination for bulk operations
- **Discovery Commands to Run:**
  - `grep -r "get_qbo_data_for_digest" . --include="*.py"` - Find all usage of wrong pattern
  - `grep -r "for_digest" . --include="*.py"` - Find all for_digest methods that need removal
  - `grep -r "get_.*_for_digest" domains/` - Find scattered for_digest methods in domains
  - `grep -r "bulk" runway/experiences/digest.py` - Check current bulk operations
- **Files to Read First:**
  - `runway/experiences/digest.py` - Current wrong implementation
  - `domains/qbo/data_service.py` - Contains wrong pattern methods
  - `domains/qbo/service.py` - QBOBulkScheduledService for proper bulk
  - `infra/jobs/smart_sync.py` - SmartSync for bulk orchestration
- **Dependencies:** `Create Solution Analysis Framework`
- **Verification:** 
  - All `get_qbo_data_for_digest` usage removed from digest
  - Proper bulk operations implemented for Friday morning jobs
  - Digest pulls across lots of entities for all customers efficiently
  - No more scattered `get_X_for_digest` methods in domains
- **Definition of Done:**
  - Digest uses proper bulk operations instead of `get_qbo_data_for_digest`
  - Friday morning jobs coordinate bulk data fetching for all customers
  - All `get_X_for_digest` methods removed from domains
  - Digest efficiently pulls across lots of entities in coordinated bulk operations
- **Solution Required:** Analysis of wrong pattern usage, design of proper bulk operations architecture

#### **Task 5: Replace Mock Violations with Real QBO Data**
- **Status:** `[ ]` Not started
- **Priority:** P1 High
- **Justification:** Replace hardcoded mocks with real QBO API calls and need realistic sandbox data for testing. Current system has mock violations that break the "no more mocks" commitment.

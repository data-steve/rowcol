# Needs Solving Tasks - Data Architecture & Experience Cleanup

*Updated after nuclear cleanup completion on 2025-01-27*  
*Status: Ready

## **Task Complexity Curation**

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS SOLUTION WORK (6 tasks)** - These tasks require:
- Analysis and discovery work
- "Figure out" or "determine" language present
- Dependencies on other solution tasks
- Architectural decisions that need human input
- Cannot be executed without solution phase

---

## **Context for All Tasks**

**IMPORTANT**: Before starting any solutioning work, read `LAUNCH_SOLUTIONING_TASKS.md` twice. It contains the complete solutioning framework and methodology you must follow.

### **Nuclear Cleanup Foundation - COMPLETED ‚úÖ**
The QBO architecture has been completely reset and rebuilt with clean separation of concerns:

**‚úÖ COMPLETED NUCLEAR CLEANUP:**
- **Clean Architecture**: `Domain Service ‚Üí SmartSyncService ‚Üí Raw QBO HTTP Calls`
- **No Circular Dependencies**: Infrastructure independence maintained
- **Integration Model Simplified**: QBO fields moved to Business model
- **SmartSync Test Patterns**: All tests use new architecture
- **Database Fixtures**: Centralized database connection patterns
- **Mock Violations Documented**: Ready for comprehensive test data service

### **Current Architecture State (Post-Nuclear)**
- **SmartSyncService** (`infra/qbo/smart_sync.py`): Central orchestration layer for ALL QBO interactions. Handles retries, deduplication, rate limiting, and caching. Provides resilience infrastructure for domain services.
- **QBORawClient** (`infra/qbo/client.py`): Raw HTTP calls to QBO endpoints only. No business logic, no orchestration.
- **Domain Services** (`domains/*/services/`): Handle their own CRUD operations and business logic using SmartSyncService.
- **Business Model**: Contains QBO connection fields (`qbo_realm_id`, `qbo_access_token`, etc.) - Integration model removed.

### **Key Architecture Principle**
Domain services handle their own business logic and CRUD operations. SmartSyncService provides resilience infrastructure (retry, dedup, rate limiting, caching). Raw QBO client just makes HTTP calls. Clean dependency flow with no circular dependencies.

### **Critical Context for Future Developers**

**üö® READ THIS FIRST - What Was Accomplished in Nuclear Cleanup:**

The QBO architecture was completely reset and rebuilt. Key changes that affect these solution tasks:

1. **Deleted Components** (tasks may reference these - they're gone):
   - `domains/qbo/` directory (entire directory deleted)
   - `domains/integrations/qbo/` directory (entire directory deleted)
   - `Integration` model (removed, QBO fields moved to Business model)
   - `infra/jobs/smart_sync.py` (moved to `infra/qbo/smart_sync.py`)

2. **New Components** (tasks should use these):
   - `infra/qbo/smart_sync.py` - SmartSyncService (moved from infra/jobs/)
   - `infra/qbo/client.py` - QBORawClient (new raw HTTP client)
   - `domains/core/models/business.py` - Now has QBO fields (qbo_realm_id, qbo_access_token, etc.)
   - `tests/conftest.py` - New database fixtures (prod_database_session, qbo_connected_business)

3. **New Patterns** (tasks should follow these):
   - Use `SmartSyncService` for all QBO operations
   - Use `Business` model QBO fields instead of Integration model
   - Use database fixtures instead of inline database connections
   - Use new test patterns documented in nuclear cleanup

4. **Mock Violations** (documented for cleanup):
   - See `zzz_fix_backlogs/backlog/008_eliminate_remaining_mock_violations.md`
   - Tests need comprehensive test data service solution
   - Experience services have mock data that needs real QBO data

**Before starting any solution task, verify it aligns with these changes!**

### **QBO Fragility Context**
QuickBooks Online API has well-documented fragility that can disrupt the cash runway ritual:
- **Rate Limiting**: 500 requests/min per app, 100 requests/sec per realm
- **Intermittent Failures**: 503 Service Unavailable, network latency, maintenance windows
- **Duplicate Actions**: Retrying failed requests can create duplicate transactions
- **Lost Actions**: QBO's async processing can make actions appear to fail when they succeeded
- **Data Inconsistencies**: QBO data may not reflect real-time changes
- **Webhook Reliability**: Missed events, out-of-order delivery, duplicates

### **Product Context**
Oodaloo is a cash runway management tool for service agencies ($1M‚Äì$5M, 10-30 staff) that automates 70-80% of weekly cash runway decisions through QBO integration. The core value proposition is the "weekly cash runway ritual" - a seamless, trustworthy experience where users can make immediate decisions (pay bills, send reminders) with real-time feedback.

**Key Challenge**: These tasks require understanding complex relationships and making architectural decisions that affect multiple parts of the system.

## **Development Environment Setup**

**IMPORTANT**: Start your development session with:
```bash
cd ~/projects/oodaloo
poetry shell
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
This activates the virtual environment and starts the application once. Keep uvicorn running in the background throughout your analysis work.

#### **Task 4: Fix Digest Data Architecture - Replace Wrong `get_qbo_data_for_digest` Pattern**
- **Status:** `[ ]` Not started
- **Priority:** P1 High
- **Justification:** Digest is using the wrong data pattern (`get_qbo_data_for_digest`) instead of proper bulk operations. Digest needs to pull across lots of entities and run calculators for all customers on Friday morning jobs - this requires bulk operations on 2 dimensions, not generic data fetching. The `get_qbo_data_for_digest` pattern was decided against because it's a singular solution for every experience when each experience should get data from its specific calculator.
- **Code Pointers:**
  - `runway/experiences/digest.py` - Currently uses wrong `get_qbo_data_for_digest` pattern
  - `domains/qbo/data_service.py` - Contains `get_qbo_data_for_digest` methods that need removal
  - `domains/qbo/service.py` - QBOBulkScheduledService for proper bulk operations
  - `infra/jobs/smart_sync.py` - SmartSync orchestration for bulk operations
- **Current Issues to Resolve:**
  - Digest uses `get_qbo_data_for_digest` which is the wrong pattern
  - Need proper bulk operations that pull across lots of entities for all customers
  - Friday morning jobs need coordinated bulk data fetching, not individual data calls
  - `get_qbo_data_for_digest` pattern exists throughout domains and needs removal
- **Required Analysis:**
  - Analyze current `get_qbo_data_for_digest` usage across all files
  - Design proper bulk operations architecture for digest
  - Determine how digest should pull across lots of entities for all customers
  - Design Friday morning job coordination for bulk operations
- **Discovery Commands to Run:**
  - `grep -r "get_qbo_data_for_digest" . --include="*.py"` - Find all usage of wrong pattern
  - `grep -r "for_digest" . --include="*.py"` - Find all for_digest methods that need removal
  - `grep -r "get_.*_for_digest" domains/` - Find scattered for_digest methods in domains
  - `grep -r "bulk" runway/experiences/digest.py` - Check current bulk operations
- **Files to Read First:**
  - `runway/experiences/digest.py` - Current wrong implementation
  - `domains/qbo/data_service.py` - Contains wrong pattern methods
  - `domains/qbo/service.py` - QBOBulkScheduledService for proper bulk
  - `infra/jobs/smart_sync.py` - SmartSync for bulk orchestration
- **Dependencies:** `Create Solution Analysis Framework`
- **Verification:** 
  - All `get_qbo_data_for_digest` usage removed from digest
  - Proper bulk operations implemented for Friday morning jobs
  - Digest pulls across lots of entities for all customers efficiently
  - No more scattered `get_X_for_digest` methods in domains
- **Definition of Done:**
  - Digest uses proper bulk operations instead of `get_qbo_data_for_digest`
  - Friday morning jobs coordinate bulk data fetching for all customers
  - All `get_X_for_digest` methods removed from domains
  - Digest efficiently pulls across lots of entities in coordinated bulk operations

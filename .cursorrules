# RowCol MVP Recovery - Cursor Rules
# This file prevents contamination during the Strangler-Fig recovery process

## Ways of Working
Remeber I'm a junior dev w principal MLE and product chops vibe coding my own infra heavy product. So you gotta help me along: I think this note should be added to the .cursorrules so I don't have to keep bringing it up.

## TESTING RULES
- NEVER use mocks in tests - all tests must hit real QBO API
- NEVER use unittest.mock.Mock, unittest.mock.AsyncMock, or @patch decorators
- NEVER create fake/mock QBO responses - use real sandbox data
- ALL QBO tests must use real authentication and real API calls
- Use pytest fixtures from conftest.py for database and QBO tokens
- Tests should verify real integration works, not mock behavior
- NEVER delete tests just because they fail or use mocks
- ALWAYS fix/cleanse tests to work with real API calls instead of deleting
- Principle: CLEANSE AND FIX over DELETING
- If a test is fundamentally wrong, discuss with user before deleting

## SECURITY RULES
- NEVER print sensitive data (tokens, keys, passwords) in the context window
- NEVER print access tokens, refresh tokens, or any authentication credentials
- NEVER print API keys, secrets, or any sensitive configuration values
- NEVER print database connection strings or credentials
- NEVER print any data that contains "token", "key", "secret", "password", "credential"
- NEVER print partial tokens, truncated tokens, or any portion of sensitive data
- NEVER print token existence status, token lengths, or token metadata
- Access and refresh tokens belong in the database, not .env files
- Only print non-sensitive identifiers (realm_id, business_id, etc.)
- When debugging authentication issues, use placeholder text like "TOKEN_REDACTED" or "***"
- FORCE: Use boolean checks (exists/not exists) instead of printing token data
- FORCE: Use status indicators (✅/❌) instead of printing sensitive values

## ALLOWED PATHS
You may modify files ONLY under:
- _clean/**
- scripts/ci_guard.sh
- README.md (root level only)

## BLOCKED PATHS
Do not create, edit, or delete files outside the paths above.

## LEGACY CODE HANDLING
When asked to use legacy code, prefer:
- copying only the minimal functions needed into _clean/mvp/infra/** but they have to be sanitized first
- assume it will need refactoring to align with new requirements
- and possibly also implementing a thinned down version so we get out from under scope-creep and pivot-cruft

## BLOCKED IMPORTS
Do not import from legacy folders:
- runway/services/data_orchestrators/**
- domains/*/services/** (contain architectural rot)
- infra/qbo/** (legacy paths outside MVP)
- infra/jobs/** (job scheduler, job storage)
- plaid/**, ramp/**, stripe/**
- Any path outside _clean/**

## ARCHITECTURE ENFORCEMENT
All Runway code must depend on Domains gateway interfaces only.
- runway/ → domains/ → infra/ (no back edges, ever)
- Domains define interfaces; Infra implements them; Runway composes
- Use composition root (wiring.py) for dependency injection

## RECOVERY CONTEXT
This is a Strangler-Fig recovery to eliminate architectural rot.
- Current domains contain rot - they bypass Smart Sync pattern
- We must establish clean architecture first, then rebuild domains
- QBO-only MVP first, then add other rails using same patterns

## FILE STRUCTURE
Follow the structure defined in _clean/mvp/recovery_build_plan.md:
- _clean/mvp/runway/ - Product orchestration and calculators
- _clean/mvp/domains/ - Rail-agnostic interfaces only
- _clean/mvp/infra/ - QBO client, sync orchestrator, repos

## TESTING
All changes must include tests that verify:
- STRICT beats cache (snapshot edge)
- Bill tray service works correctly
- Console snapshot service works correctly
- Throttle hygiene (QBO 429)
- Stale mirror hygiene

## MIGRATION MANIFEST
Reference _clean/strangled_fig/migration_manifest.md for concrete porting instructions.

## GIT COMMIT RULES
- Always double-check git status before any commit
- Keep commits atomic: commit only the files you touched and list each path explicitly
- For tracked files run `git commit -m "<scoped message>" -- path/to/file1 path/to/file2`
- Quote any git paths containing brackets or parentheses when staging or committing
- Never amend commits unless you have explicit written approval in the task thread

## FILE DELETION RULES
- Delete unused or obsolete files when your changes make them irrelevant (refactors, feature removals, etc.)
- Before attempting to delete a file to resolve a local type/lint failure, stop and ask the user
- NEVER edit `.env` or any environment variable files—only the user may change them
- Moving/renaming and restoring files is allowed

## DESTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS
- ABSOLUTELY NEVER run destructive git operations (e.g., `git reset --hard`, `rm`, `git checkout`/`git restore` to an older commit) unless the user gives an explicit, written instruction
- Never use `git restore` to revert files you didn't author

## CODE EDITING PREFERENCES
- NEVER delete tests just because they are failing - always fix/cleanse instead
- PREFER editing existing files rather than writing new files
- Principle: CLEANSE AND FIX over DELETING
- If a test is fundamentally wrong, discuss with user before deleting

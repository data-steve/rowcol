# RowCol MVP Recovery - Executable Tasks

*Ready for hands-free execution with comprehensive discovery and validation*

## **CRITICAL: Context Files (MANDATORY)**

### **Architecture Context (2-3 most relevant):**
- `_clean/architecture/comprehensive_architecture.md` - Complete architecture vision
- `_clean/architecture/ADR-005-qbo-api-strategy.md` - QBO integration strategy with Smart Sync
- `_clean/architecture/ADR-001-domains-runway-separation.md` - Domain separation principles

### **Product Context (1-2 most relevant):**
- `_clean/mvp/mvp_comprehensive_prd.md` - **COMPREHENSIVE MVP PRD** (read this first!)
- `_clean/e2e/product_strategy.md` - Complete e2e product vision

### **Recovery Context (1-2 most relevant):**
- `_clean/strangled_fig/migration_manifest.md` - File-by-file porting instructions
- `_clean/strangled_fig/stepped_plan.md` - Detailed implementation roadmap

### **Current Phase Context:**
- **Phase 0.5**: QBO-only MVP (current focus)
- **Feature Gating**: QBO-only mode enabled, Ramp/Plaid/Stripe disabled
- **Payment Execution**: QBO sync-only (no execution), Ramp execution gated
- **Data Architecture**: Local mirroring + Smart Sync pattern for live data
- **Database**: SQLite (`rowcol.db`) for MVP, not `oodaloo.db`
- **Testing**: Real QBO API calls, no mocking - use sandbox credentials

---

## **CRITICAL: Execution Guidelines (MANDATORY)**

### **Discovery & Validation Process (MANDATORY)**
**NEVER execute tasks without validating assumptions against reality.**

#### **Required Validation Steps:**
1. **Run Discovery Commands** - Find all occurrences of patterns mentioned in tasks
2. **Read Actual Code** - Don't assume task descriptions are accurate
3. **Compare Assumptions vs Reality** - Document mismatches
4. **Identify Architecture Gaps** - Understand current vs intended state
5. **Question Task Scope** - Are tasks solving the right problems?

#### **Discovery Documentation Template:**
```
### What Actually Exists:
- [List what you found that exists]

### What the Task Assumed:
- [List what the task assumed exists]

### Assumptions That Were Wrong:
- [List assumptions that don't match reality]

### Architecture Mismatches:
- [List where current implementation differs from intended architecture]

### Task Scope Issues:
- [List where tasks may be solving wrong problems or have unclear scope]
```

#### **CRITICAL: Recursive Discovery/Triage Pattern (MANDATORY)**
**NEVER do blind search-and-replace!** This pattern prevents costly mistakes:

1. **Search for all occurrences** of the pattern you need to fix
2. **Read the broader context** around each occurrence to understand what the method, service, route, or file is doing
3. **Triage each occurrence** - determine if it needs:
   - Simple replacement (exact match)
   - Contextual update (needs broader changes)
   - Complete overhaul (needs significant refactoring)
   - No change (false positive or already correct)
4. **Plan comprehensive updates** - ensure your fixes cover all cases and edge cases
5. **Handle dependencies** - update related imports, method calls, and references
6. **Verify the fix** - test that the change works in context

## **Task 1: Bootstrap MVP Nucleus**

- **Status:** `[‚úÖ]` Completed
- **Priority:** P0 Critical
- **Justification:** Foundation for all other tasks - must be done first
- **Execution Status:** **Execution-Ready**

### **Task Checklist:**
- [x] Create `_clean/mvp/` directory structure
- [x] Create `.cursorrules` file with edit scope restrictions
- [x] Create `scripts/ci_guard.sh` with CI guard script
- [x] Create `pyproject.toml` with minimal dependencies
- [x] Create `api/routes.py` with basic FastAPI app
- [x] FastAPI app runs without errors
- [x] `/healthz` endpoint returns {"status": "ok"}
- [x] All files are properly structured and documented

### **Problem Statement**
Need to create the basic MVP structure with proper guards and minimal FastAPI app to establish the foundation for the Strangler-Fig recovery.

### **User Story**
"As a developer, I need a clean MVP nucleus with proper guards so that I can safely build the new architecture without contaminating the legacy codebase."

### **Solution Overview**
Create `_clean/mvp/` structure with `.cursorrules`, CI guards, basic FastAPI app, and proper isolation from legacy code.

### **CRITICAL: Assumption Validation Before Execution (MANDATORY)**
**NEVER execute tasks without validating assumptions against reality.**

#### **Required Validation Steps:**
1. **Run Discovery Commands** - Find all occurrences of patterns mentioned in tasks
2. **Read Actual Code** - Don't assume task descriptions are accurate
3. **Compare Assumptions vs Reality** - Document mismatches
4. **Identify Architecture Gaps** - Understand current vs intended state
5. **Question Task Scope** - Are tasks solving the right problems?

#### **Discovery Documentation Template:**
```
### What Actually Exists:
- [List what you found that exists]

### What the Task Assumed:
- [List what the task assumed exists]

### Assumptions That Were Wrong:
- [List assumptions that don't match reality]

### Architecture Mismatches:
- [List where current implementation differs from intended architecture]

### Task Scope Issues:
- [List where tasks may be solving wrong problems or have unclear scope]
```

### **CRITICAL: Recursive Discovery/Triage Pattern (MANDATORY)**
**NEVER do blind search-and-replace!** This pattern prevents costly mistakes:

1. **Search for all occurrences** of the pattern you need to fix
2. **Read the broader context** around each occurrence to understand what the method, service, route, or file is doing
3. **Triage each occurrence** - determine if it needs:
   - Simple replacement (exact match)
   - Contextual update (needs broader changes)
   - Complete overhaul (needs significant refactoring)
   - No change (false positive or already correct)
4. **Plan comprehensive updates** - ensure your fixes cover all cases and edge cases
5. **Handle dependencies** - update related imports, method calls, and references
6. **Verify the fix** - test that the change works in context

- **Initial Files to Fix:** (Starting point - NOT comprehensive)
  - Create `_clean/mvp/` directory structure
  - Create `.cursorrules` file
  - Create `scripts/ci_guard.sh`
  - Create `pyproject.toml`
  - Create `api/routes.py` with FastAPI app

- **MANDATORY: Comprehensive Discovery Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Check current directory structure
  ls -la _clean/
  ls -la scripts/
  
  # Check for existing .cursorrules
  find . -name ".cursorrules" -type f
  find . -name "ci_guard.sh" -type f
  
  # Check for existing pyproject.toml
  find . -name "pyproject.toml" -type f
  
  # Check for existing FastAPI apps
  grep -r "fastapi" . --include="*.py" | head -10
  grep -r "uvicorn" . --include="*.py" | head -10
  ```

- **MANDATORY: Recursive Triage Process:**
  1. **For each file found in discovery:**
     - Read the broader context around each occurrence
     - Understand what the method/service/route is doing
     - Determine if it needs simple replacement, contextual update, or complete overhaul
     - Identify all related imports, method calls, and dependencies
  2. **Map the real system:**
     - How do these pieces actually connect?
     - What are the real data flows?
     - What would break if you changed it?
  3. **Plan comprehensive updates:**
     - Create new files with proper structure
     - Ensure all dependencies are handled
     - Handle edge cases and multiple patterns in same file
     - Update related logic that depends on the changes

- **Pattern to Implement:**
  ```python
  # _clean/mvp/api/routes.py
  from fastapi import FastAPI, APIRouter
  
  app = FastAPI(title="RowCol MVP", version="0.1.0")
  router = APIRouter()

- [x] **Infra Gateways Fixed**: All gateways now use raw HTTP methods from QBO client
- [x] **Real QBO API Testing**: QBO sandbox connectivity proven with working tokens and auto-refresh

### **Problem Statement**
Need to copy and sanitize existing QBO infrastructure (config, auth, utils, client, DTOs) from legacy codebase to MVP nucleus, removing dependencies and aligning with new architecture.

### **User Story**
"As a developer, I need clean QBO infrastructure in the MVP so that I can make real API calls to QBO sandbox without legacy dependencies."

### **Solution Overview**
Copy existing QBO files from `infra/qbo/` to `_clean/mvp/infra/rails/qbo/`, sanitize for MVP, and ensure proper isolation from legacy code.

## **Task 4: Implement Sync Orchestrator**

- **Status:** `[‚úÖ]` Completed
- **Priority:** P0 Critical
- **Justification:** Sync orchestrator is the core of the Smart Sync pattern - must be done fourth
- **Execution Status:** **Execution-Ready**

### **Task Checklist:**
- [x] Create `_clean/mvp/infra/sync/orchestrator.py` with sync orchestrator
- [x] Create `_clean/mvp/infra/sync/base_sync_service.py` with base sync service
- [x] Create `_clean/mvp/infra/sync/entity_policy.py` with entity TTL configuration
- [x] All files can be imported without errors
- [x] Sync orchestrator can be instantiated
- [x] All files are properly documented

### **Problem Statement**
Need to implement the sync orchestrator with Smart Sync pattern, policy-driven facade, and proper transaction logging.

### **User Story**
"As a developer, I need a sync orchestrator that implements the Smart Sync pattern so that I can properly manage data freshness and transaction logging."

### **Solution Overview**
Create sync orchestrator with policy-driven facade over BaseSyncService, entity TTL configuration, and proper log ‚Üí mirror ordering.

### **CRITICAL: Assumption Validation Before Execution (MANDATORY)**
**NEVER execute tasks without validating assumptions against reality.**

#### **Required Validation Steps:**
1. **Run Discovery Commands** - Find all occurrences of patterns mentioned in tasks
2. **Read Actual Code** - Don't assume task descriptions are accurate
3. **Compare Assumptions vs Reality** - Document mismatches
4. **Identify Architecture Gaps** - Understand current vs intended state
5. **Question Task Scope** - Are tasks solving the right problems?

#### **Discovery Documentation Template:**
```
### What Actually Exists:
- [List what you found that exists]

### What the Task Assumed:
- [List what the task assumed exists]

### Assumptions That Were Wrong:
- [List assumptions that don't match reality]

### Architecture Mismatches:
- [List where current implementation differs from intended architecture]

### Task Scope Issues:
- [List where tasks may be solving wrong problems or have unclear scope]
```

### **CRITICAL: Recursive Discovery/Triage Pattern (MANDATORY)**
**NEVER do blind search-and-replace!** This pattern prevents costly mistakes:

1. **Search for all occurrences** of the pattern you need to fix
2. **Read the broader context** around each occurrence to understand what the method, service, route, or file is doing
3. **Triage each occurrence** - determine if it needs:
   - Simple replacement (exact match)
   - Contextual update (needs broader changes)
   - Complete overhaul (needs significant refactoring)
   - No change (false positive or already correct)
4. **Plan comprehensive updates** - ensure your fixes cover all cases and edge cases
5. **Handle dependencies** - update related imports, method calls, and references
6. **Verify the fix** - test that the change works in context

- **Initial Files to Fix:** (Starting point - NOT comprehensive)
  - Create `_clean/mvp/infra/sync/orchestrator.py`
  - Create `_clean/mvp/infra/sync/base_sync_service.py`
  - Create `_clean/mvp/infra/sync/entity_policy.py`

- **MANDATORY: Comprehensive Discovery Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Find existing sync patterns
  grep -r "BaseSyncService" . --include="*.py" | head -20
  grep -r "sync.*service" . --include="*.py" | head -20
  grep -r "orchestrator" . --include="*.py" | head -20
  grep -r "SmartSync" . --include="*.py" | head -20
  
  # Check existing sync files
  ls -la infra/jobs/
  cat infra/jobs/base_sync_service.py | head -20
  cat domains/qbo/services/sync_service.py | head -20
  ```

- **MANDATORY: Recursive Triage Process:**
  1. **For each file found in discovery:**
     - Read the broader context around each occurrence
     - Understand what the method/service/route is doing
     - Determine if it needs simple replacement, contextual update, or complete overhaul
     - Identify all related imports, method calls, and dependencies
  2. **Map the real system:**
     - How do these pieces actually connect?
     - What are the real data flows?
     - What would break if you changed it?
  3. **Plan comprehensive updates:**
     - Create new files with proper structure
     - Ensure all dependencies are handled
     - Handle edge cases and multiple patterns in same file
     - Update related logic that depends on the changes

- **Pattern to Implement:**
  ```python
  # _clean/mvp/infra/sync/orchestrator.py
  from typing import Literal, Callable, Any
  from datetime import datetime
  
  class SyncOrchestrator:
      def read_refresh(
          self,
          entity: str,                    # "bills", "invoices", "balances"
          client_id: str,                 # advisor_id in MVP
          hint: Literal["CACHED_OK", "STRICT"],
          mirror_is_fresh: Callable[[str, str, dict], bool],
          fetch_remote: Callable[[], tuple[list[dict], str | None]],
          upsert_mirror: Callable[[list[dict], str | None, datetime], None],
          read_from_mirror: Callable[[], list[Any]],
          on_hygiene: Callable[[str, str], None],
      ) -> list[Any]:
          # Policy-driven freshness check
          # STRICT or stale/expired ‚Üí rail ‚Üí INBOUND log ‚Üí mirror upsert ‚Üí return mirror
          # CACHED_OK + fresh ‚Üí return mirror
          # Error ‚Üí log failure + hygiene flag + return stale mirror

- [x] All implementations use sync orchestrator
- [x] All implementations use QBO client
- [x] All files can be imported without errors
- [x] All implementations are properly documented

### **CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED:**
- [ ] **Balances Gateway Calls Non-Existent Methods**:
  - Line 72: `await self.qbo_client.get_account_by_id(account_id)` - method doesn't exist
  - Line 85: `balances_data = await self.qbo_client.get_accounts_from_qbo()` - method doesn't exist
- [ ] **Invoices Gateway Calls Non-Existent Methods**:
  - Line 199: `invoices_data = self.qbo_client.get_invoices_from_qbo(status=status)` - method doesn't exist
- [ ] **Bills Gateway is Correct**: Uses raw HTTP methods properly (`get()`, `put()`)
- [ ] **Need to Fix Gateway Methods**: Replace non-existent calls with raw HTTP calls

### **Problem Statement**
Need to implement infrastructure gateways that implement domain interfaces using the sync orchestrator and QBO client.

### **User Story**

## **Task 7: Bridge Domain Gateways to Runway Services**

- **Status:** `[‚úÖ]` Complete
- **Priority:** P1 High
- **Justification:** Critical bridge between new domain gateways and existing runway services - requires solutioning before implementation
- **Execution Status:** **Implementation Ready**

### **Task Checklist:**
- [x] Analyze existing data orchestrators to understand current patterns ‚úÖ
- [x] Design domain gateway filtering methods for incomplete vs complete records ‚úÖ
- [x] Design wiring layer to replace data orchestrators with domain gateways ‚úÖ
- [x] Design humble QBO-only experience focused on client list and digest ‚úÖ
- [x] Remove QBO execution assumptions and focus on bookkeeping tasks only ‚úÖ
- [x] Implement domain gateway filtering methods ‚úÖ
- [x] Create wiring layer to replace data orchestrators ‚úÖ
- [x] Update experience services to use domain gateways ‚úÖ
- [x] All files can be imported without errors ‚úÖ
- [x] All services work with filtered data instead of full data pulls ‚úÖ

### **Problem Statement**
Need to bridge the new domain gateways to existing runway services while fixing architectural problems:
1. **Indiscriminate Data Pulling**: All services pull ALL bills/invoices instead of filtered data
2. **Wrong Filtering Strategy**: Filtering done in runway instead of at API level
3. **QBO Execution Assumptions**: Code assumes QBO can execute payments (it can't)
4. **Missing Product Focus**: Architecture doesn't reflect humble QBO-only dashboard vision

### **User Story**
"As a developer, I need to bridge domain gateways to runway services so that we can fix the architectural problems and focus on the humble QBO-only dashboard product vision."

### **Solution Overview**
Replace data orchestrators with domain gateways that provide filtered data:
- **Hygiene Tray**: Only incomplete records (missing vendor, amounts, dates)
- **Decision Console**: Only complete records ready for decision-making
- **Digest**: Consumes Tray + Console outputs, no direct QBO calls

### **SOLUTIONING COMPLETED ‚úÖ**

#### **Key Problems Identified:**
1. **Indiscriminate Data Pulling**: All data orchestrators pull ALL bills/invoices instead of filtered data
2. **Wrong Filtering Strategy**: Filtering done in runway instead of at API level
3. **QBO Execution Assumptions**: Code assumes QBO can execute payments (it can't)
4. **Missing Product Focus**: Architecture doesn't reflect humble QBO-only dashboard vision

#### **Solution: Domain Gateway Filtering**
- **Hygiene Tray**: `BillsGateway.list_incomplete()` ‚Üí Only bills with missing data
- **Decision Console**: `BillsGateway.list_payment_ready()` ‚Üí Only bills ready for payment scheduling
- **Collections Console**: `InvoicesGateway.list_collections_ready()` ‚Üí Only invoices 30+ days overdue needing collections attention
- **Digest**: Consumes Tray + Console outputs ‚Üí No direct QBO calls

#### **AP vs AR Payment History Clarification:**
- **Bills (AP)**: `get_payment_history()` ‚Üí Bills that have been **sent for payment** (outgoing payments)
- **Invoices (AR)**: `get_payment_history()` ‚Üí Invoices that have **received payment** (incoming payments)
- **QBO Reality**: QBO is bookkeeping hub - can track payment status but cannot execute payments or send invoices

#### **Architecture Compliance:**
- ‚úÖ **ADR-001**: Three-layer architecture `runway/ ‚Üí domains/ ‚Üí infra/`
- ‚úÖ **ADR-005**: Smart Sync Pattern with sync orchestrator
- ‚úÖ **Smart Sync Lessons**: Fix missing connections, implement smart switching

#### **Realistic QBO-Only MVP Decisions:**

**Bills (AP) - Payment Scheduling Flow:**
- Hygiene Issues ‚Üí Fix missing vendor/amounts/dates ‚Üí Mark as "ready for payment scheduling"
- Payment Scheduling ‚Üí "Schedule payment for next week" (manual QBO entry)
- Payment Tracking ‚Üí "Bill was paid on [date]" (status update)

**Invoices (AR) - Collections Flow:**
- Data Quality ‚Üí Fix missing customer/amounts/dates ‚Üí Mark as "ready for sending"
- Collections ‚Üí "Invoice 30+ days overdue ‚Üí Call customer" (WWW task for weekly cash call)
- Payment Matching ‚Üí "Received $500 ‚Üí Match to Invoice #123" (reconciliation)

**QBO Limitations (Current State):**
- Cannot send invoices (no email/SMS APIs)
- Cannot execute payments (no money movement)
- Cannot create invoices (no invoice creation API)
- Can only track status, record payments, and provide aging reports

### **Dependencies:** Task 6 (Implement Infra Gateways)

### **Verification:** 
- Run `ls -la _clean/mvp/runway/` - should show updated runway structure
- Run `python -c "from runway.wiring import create_hygiene_tray_service; print('Runway wiring works')"`
- Verify services use filtered data instead of full data pulls
- Verify QBO execution assumptions removed

### **Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Domain gateways extended with filtering methods
- [ ] Wiring layer created to replace data orchestrators
- [ ] Experience services updated to use domain gateways
- [ ] QBO execution assumptions removed
- [ ] Architecture aligned with humble QBO-only dashboard vision
- [ ] All services work with filtered data instead of full data pulls
- [ ] All files can be imported without errors

### **Progress Tracking:**
- Update status to `[üîÑ]` when starting solutioning
- Update status to `[‚úÖ]` when solutioning complete and implementation ready
- Update status to `[‚ùå]` if blocked or failed

### **Git Commit:**
- After completing solutioning, commit the solutioning document:
- `git add _clean/mvp/architecture_bridge_solutioning.md`
- `git commit -m "docs: add architecture bridge solutioning analysis"`

### **Todo List Integration:**
- Create Cursor todo for this task when starting
- Update todo status as work progresses
- Mark todo complete when task is done
- Add cleanup todos for discovered edge cases
- Remove obsolete todos when files are created
- Ensure todo list reflects current system state

### **CRITICAL: Assumption Validation Before Execution (MANDATORY)**
**NEVER execute tasks without validating assumptions against reality.**

#### **Required Validation Steps:**
1. **Run Discovery Commands** - Find all occurrences of patterns mentioned in tasks
2. **Read Actual Code** - Don't assume task descriptions are accurate
3. **Compare Assumptions vs Reality** - Document mismatches
4. **Identify Architecture Gaps** - Understand current vs intended state
5. **Question Task Scope** - Are tasks solving the right problems?

#### **Discovery Documentation Template:**
```
### What Actually Exists:
- [List what you found that exists]

### What the Task Assumed:
- [List what the task assumed exists]

### Assumptions That Were Wrong:
- [List assumptions that don't match reality]

### Architecture Mismatches:
- [List where current implementation differs from intended architecture]

### Task Scope Issues:
- [List where tasks may be solving wrong problems or have unclear scope]
```

### **CRITICAL: Recursive Discovery/Triage Pattern (MANDATORY)**
**NEVER do blind search-and-replace!** This pattern prevents costly mistakes:

1. **Search for all occurrences** of the pattern you need to fix
2. **Read the broader context** around each occurrence to understand what the method, service, route, or file is doing
3. **Triage each occurrence** - determine if it needs:
   - Simple replacement (exact match)
   - Contextual update (needs broader changes)
   - Complete overhaul (needs significant refactoring)
   - No change (false positive or already correct)
4. **Plan comprehensive updates** - ensure your fixes cover all cases and edge cases
5. **Handle dependencies** - update related imports, method calls, and references
6. **Verify the fix** - test that the change works in context

- **Initial Files to Fix:** (Starting point - NOT comprehensive)
  - Create `_clean/mvp/runway/wiring.py`
  - Create `_clean/mvp/runway/services/runway_orchestrator.py`
  - Update `_clean/mvp/api/routes.py` with real endpoints

- **MANDATORY: Comprehensive Discovery Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Find existing runway patterns
  grep -r "runway/" . --include="*.py" | head -20
  grep -r "orchestrator" . --include="*.py" | head -20
  grep -r "tray" . --include="*.py" | head -20
  grep -r "console" . --include="*.py" | head -20
  grep -r "digest" . --include="*.py" | head -20
  ```

- **MANDATORY: Recursive Triage Process:**
  1. **For each file found in discovery:**
     - Read the broader context around each occurrence
     - Understand what the method/service/route is doing
     - Determine if it needs simple replacement, contextual update, or complete overhaul
     - Identify all related imports, method calls, and dependencies
  2. **Map the real system:**
     - How do these pieces actually connect?
     - What are the real data flows?
     - What would break if you changed it?
  3. **Plan comprehensive updates:**
     - Create new files with proper structure
     - Ensure all dependencies are handled
     - Handle edge cases and multiple patterns in same file
     - Update related logic that depends on the changes

- **Pattern to Implement:**
  ```python
  # _clean/mvp/runway/wiring.py
  from infra.gateways.ap_qbo_gateway import QBOBillsGateway

## **Task 8: Test Gateway and Wiring Layer**

- **Status:** `[‚ùå]` **FAILED - QBO API NEVER TESTED**
- **Priority:** P1 High
- **Justification:** Test the gateway filtering and wiring layer before building experience services
- **Execution Status:** **Execution-Ready**

### **Task Checklist:**
- [x] Create `_clean/mvp/tests/test_domain_gateways.py` with gateway filtering tests ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `_clean/mvp/tests/test_smart_sync.py` with Smart Sync pattern tests ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `_clean/mvp/tests/test_wiring_layer.py` with composition root tests ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `_clean/mvp/tests/test_qbo_throttling.py` with QBO throttling tests ‚úÖ

- [x] All tests can be run without errors ‚úÖ
- [x] All tests validate gateway filtering methods ‚úÖ
- [x] All tests validate Smart Sync pattern ‚úÖ
- [x] All tests pass ‚úÖ

### **CRITICAL DISCOVERY:**
- [ ] **QBO API NEVER TESTED**: Tests were created but never actually tested real QBO API connectivity
- [ ] **Auth Service Disabled**: QBO client has `self.auth_service = None` - no authentication
- [ ] **Need Real QBO Testing**: Must test actual QBO sandbox connectivity with real credentials
- [ ] **Gateway Methods Broken**: Infra gateways call non-existent QBO client methods
- [ ] **Foundation Not Validated**: Built entire architecture on untested QBO client

### **Problem Statement**
Need to test the gateway filtering methods and wiring layer to ensure the backend foundation works correctly before building experience services.

### **User Story**
"As a developer, I need to test the gateway filtering and wiring layer so that I can validate the backend foundation works before building experience services."

### **Solution Overview**
Create focused tests for gateway filtering methods, Smart Sync pattern, and wiring layer - skip full experience service testing until we understand the advisor workflow.

## **Task 9: Port Production-Grade API Infrastructure**

- **Status:** `[üìã]` **NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION**
- **Priority:** P1 High
- **Justification:** Production-grade rate limiting, retry logic, and circuit breaker patterns needed for QBO API reliability
- **Execution Status:** **Execution-Ready**

### **Task Checklist:**
- [ ] Create `_clean/mvp/infra/api/base_client.py` with BaseAPIClient patterns
- [ ] Create `_clean/mvp/infra/api/rate_limiter.py` with rate limiting logic
- [ ] Create `_clean/mvp/infra/api/retry_handler.py` with exponential backoff retry
- [ ] Create `_clean/mvp/infra/api/circuit_breaker.py` with circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Create `_clean/mvp/infra/api/exceptions.py` with typed API errors
- [ ] Update `_clean/mvp/infra/rails/qbo/client.py` to extend BaseAPIClient
- [ ] Update `_clean/mvp/infra/rails/qbo/auth.py` with retry logic for token refresh
- [ ] All files can be imported without errors
- [ ] QBO client properly handles 429 rate limit errors
- [ ] QBO client properly retries transient failures
- [ ] All files are properly documented

### **CRITICAL DISCOVERY:**
- ‚úÖ **Legacy Has Production Patterns**: `infra/api/base_client.py` has rate limiting, retry, circuit breaker, caching
- ‚úÖ **Legacy Has Auth Patterns**: `infra/auth/auth.py` has JWT token management and HTTPBearer security
- ‚ùå **MVP Missing These Patterns**: Current QBO client has NO rate limiting, NO retry logic, NO circuit breaker
- ‚úÖ **Tests Validate Missing Behavior**: `test_qbo_throttling.py` tests behavior we don't implement yet
- ‚úÖ **Migration Manifest Requires**: Acceptance test #3: "Throttle hygiene (QBO 429 ‚Üí bounded retry ‚Üí hygiene flag visible)"

### **Problem Statement**
Need to port production-grade API infrastructure patterns from legacy `infra/api/` and `infra/auth/` to MVP nucleus:
1. **Rate Limiting**: QBO has strict rate limits - need client-side throttling
2. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Stop hammering QBO if it's down
4. **Typed Errors**: Proper exception hierarchy for different error types
5. **Auth Patterns**: JWT token management for user authentication (future)

### **User Story**
"As a developer, I need production-grade API infrastructure so that the QBO client can handle rate limits, transient failures, and circuit breaking gracefully."

### **Solution Overview**
Port the production-grade patterns from `infra/api/base_client.py` and `infra/auth/auth.py`:
- **BaseAPIClient**: Abstract base with rate limiting, retry, circuit breaker, caching
- **QBORawClient**: Extend BaseAPIClient with QBO-specific implementation
- **QBOAuthService**: Add retry logic for token refresh operations
- **Typed Errors**: APIError hierarchy for proper error handling

### **Files to Port:**

#### **From `infra/api/base_client.py`:**
```python
# Port these classes/patterns to _clean/mvp/infra/api/

1. RateLimitConfig - Configuration for rate limiting
2. RetryConfig - Configuration for retry logic  
3. CacheConfig - Configuration for response caching
4. APIError hierarchy - RateLimitError, AuthenticationError, NetworkError
5. BaseAPIClient - Abstract base with all patterns
   - _should_allow_call() - Rate limiting logic
   - _wait_for_rate_limit() - Wait logic
   - _retry_with_backoff() - Exponential backoff
   - Circuit breaker pattern
   - Response caching
```

#### **From `infra/auth/auth.py`:**
```python
# Port these patterns to _clean/mvp/infra/auth/ (for future use)

1. LoginRequest/Response models - Pydantic schemas
2. JWT token management - create_access_token(), verify_token()
3. HTTPBearer security - FastAPI security dependency
4. Password validation - Security patterns

Note: These are for FUTURE user authentication, NOT for QBO system tokens
```

```

### **QBO-Specific Rate Limits:**
From QBO API documentation:
- **Sandbox**: 30 requests per minute per realm
- **Production**: 500 requests per minute per realm
- **Burst**: Short bursts allowed but triggers throttling
- **429 Response**: Includes `Retry-After` header

### **Migration Manifest Context:**
```
PORT infra/api/base_client.py ‚Üí _clean/mvp/infra/api/base_client.py
  - Keep: Rate limiting, retry logic, circuit breaker
  - Drop: Platform enum (QBO only for MVP)
  - Adapt: Make QBO-specific rate limits configurable

PORT infra/auth/auth.py ‚Üí _clean/mvp/infra/auth/auth.py
  - Keep: JWT patterns, Pydantic schemas (for future user auth)
  - Drop: Not needed for QBO system tokens
  - Note: This is for FUTURE user authentication, not MVP
```

### **Acceptance Test (from Migration Manifest):**
```python
def test_throttle_hygiene():
    """QBO 429 ‚Üí bounded retry ‚Üí hygiene flag visible"""
    client = QBORawClient("test", "realm123")
    
    # Simulate high-volume requests
    for i in range(100):
        try:
            response = client.get("query?query=SELECT * FROM Bill MAXRESULTS 1")
        except RateLimitError as e:
            # Verify bounded retry
            assert e.retry_after is not None
            # Verify hygiene flag set
            # (This would be in sync orchestrator's on_hygiene callback)
            break
```

### **Dependencies:** Task 2 (QBO Infrastructure), Task 8 (Test Gateway and Wiring Layer)

### **Verification:** 
- Run `ls -la _clean/mvp/infra/api/` - should show API infrastructure files
- Run `python -c "from infra.api.base_client import BaseAPIClient; print('BaseAPIClient imported successfully')"`
- Run `python -c "from infra.rails.qbo.client import QBORawClient; print('QBORawClient with rate limiting')"`
- Run `pytest _clean/mvp/tests/test_qbo_throttling.py -v` - should validate rate limiting works
- Test QBO client handles 429 errors gracefully
- Test circuit breaker opens after repeated failures

### **Definition of Done:**
- [ ] API infrastructure ported from legacy to MVP
- [ ] QBO client extends BaseAPIClient with rate limiting
- [ ] QBO client handles 429 errors gracefully with retry
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern prevents hammering QBO when down
- [ ] Exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures
- [ ] Typed error hierarchy for proper exception handling
- [ ] All tests pass with real QBO API calls
- [ ] All files properly documented

### **Progress Tracking:**
- Update status to `[üîÑ]` when starting work
- Update status to `[‚úÖ]` when task is complete
- Update status to `[‚ùå]` if blocked or failed

### **Git Commit:**
- After completing verification, commit the specific files modified:
- `git add _clean/mvp/infra/api/ _clean/mvp/infra/rails/qbo/client.py _clean/mvp/infra/rails/qbo/auth.py`
- `git commit -m "feat: add production-grade API infrastructure with rate limiting and retry logic"`

### **Todo List Integration:**
- Create Cursor todo for this task when starting
- Update todo status as work progresses
- Mark todo complete when task is done

2. **Task 2**: Copy and Sanitize QBO Infrastructure (QBO Client)
3. **Task 3**: Create Database Schema and Repositories
4. **Task 4**: Implement Sync Orchestrator
5. **Task 5**: Create Domain Gateways (Rail-Agnostic Interfaces)
6. **Task 6**: Implement Infra Gateways (QBO Implementations)
7. **Task 7**: Bridge Domain Gateways to Runway Services
8. **Task 8**: Test Gateway and Wiring Layer
9. **Task 9**: Port Production-Grade API Infrastructure (Rate Limiting, Retry, Circuit Breaker)

### **Additional Solutioning Tasks**

For deeper product and workflow solutioning, see:
- **`_clean/mvp/advisor_workflow_solutioning.md`** - Tasks 10-12 for advisor workflow, calculators, and experience services

These solutioning tasks require extensive product research and user story development before implementation.

Each task includes:
- **Status tracking** with checkboxes
- **Comprehensive discovery commands** for validation
- **Recursive triage process** for safe execution
- **Specific patterns to implement** with code examples
- **Verification steps** to ensure success
- **Git commit instructions** for proper version control
- **Todo list integration** for progress tracking

**This approach ensures hands-free execution with proper validation and prevents the mistakes that led to the original architectural rot.**

"Hi, Matt.","00:03","00:04",0,"Steve Simpson"
"How are you doing?","00:04","00:06",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Very well.","00:06","00:06",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And yourself?","00:06","00:07",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Doing well.","00:08","00:09",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"It's Friday, so I can't really complain.","00:09","00:11",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yeah.","00:13","00:13",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Quite the art collection back there.","00:13","00:15",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Thanks.","00:16","00:17",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah.","00:19","00:20",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Let me see if Levi is gonna pop in.","00:20","00:22",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yeah, it looks like it's recording, so it should be good there.","00:30","00:32",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yeah, thanks for arranging that.","00:35","00:36",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I messaged Levi.","00:47","00:48",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"I don't know if I think he's planning on coming.","00:49","00:51",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Maybe he's getting to his computer.","00:51","00:53",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yeah.","00:56","00:56",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Hey, Steve.","00:57","00:58",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Hey, Matt.","00:58","00:58",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Hey.","01:01","01:02",0,"Steve Simpson"
"How are you guys doing?","01:02","01:04",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Very well on yourself.","01:04","01:05",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Good.","01:05","01:05",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Happy Friday.","01:06","01:07",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah, Happy Friday.","01:07","01:08",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Excited to chat.","01:08","01:09",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yeah.","01:10","01:10",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Thanks for being so quick about setting this up.","01:10","01:12",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I'm not sure if your preference would be to kind of run it since you run the meeting, since you have the spreadsheets and are sharing, or if you'd like me to kind of kick things off.","01:13","01:23",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Happy to do either.","01:23","01:24",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Which means why don't we share what.","01:24","01:27",0,"Steve Simpson"
"We use and see how it makes sense to you in terms of what you've seen on the QuickBooks side and kind of go from there.","01:27","01:33",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Awesome.","01:34","01:34",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Thank you, Matt.","01:34","01:37",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"You want to pull one of those up?","01:37","01:38",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"We can just kind of talk through it.","01:38","01:39",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yeah, let me get the right screen.","01:39","01:42",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"There it is.","01:48","01:48",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Got a couple things.","01:57","01:58",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So this is one of our forecasting tools where it's kind of vendor by vendor, major vendors, and kind of how they hit over the year, and then working with the client to kind of fill in revenue expectations up at the top.","02:02","02:17",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Pull up another one here in a second too.","02:19","02:21",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"That's more like taking a budget and converting it into forecasting, basically.","02:22","02:28",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"But this is a general one that's worked pretty decently in most situations, especially putting in front of clients and getting their input.","02:31","02:39",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"I think it's easily digestible.","02:39","02:41",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"And if I can, I just engage.","02:48","02:51",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Is that okay?","02:51","02:52",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah.","02:52","02:53",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Cool.","02:53","02:54",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So this is.","02:54","02:55",0,"Steve Simpson"
"The rows are bills that are coming in to a specific.","02:57","03:01",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Break it down.","03:04","03:05",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Let's break it down real quick.","03:05","03:06",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Let me.","03:06","03:07",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Let me actually just tweak this spreadsheet as we look.","03:07","03:08",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Go, go.","03:08","03:09",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And let's combine.","03:09","03:10",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Go up to the top.","03:12","03:13",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yeah.","03:15","03:16",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Matt, I apologize.","03:16","03:17",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I'm not a cpa.","03:17","03:18",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So this is.","03:18","03:21",0,"Steve Simpson"
"If this is like the typical spreadsheet every CPA does or advisor does, it's all bespoke.","03:21","03:27",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So I want to make it more standardized as we talk it through.","03:27","03:31",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I think I'll put it into some more sub.","03:31","03:32",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"High level categorization that might help us even if we just do these manually.","03:32","03:36",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So under inflows, let's create a subcategory of like small and normal.","03:38","03:48",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Matt, I don't know what we want to call that?","03:49","03:50",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Like.","03:50","03:51",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yeah, recurring.","03:53","03:54",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Like some orgs just have small contributions coming in all the time and that's like not a name donor.","03:54","04:00",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And then let's have a second category for major gifts and then under major gifts let's collapse all those so we can plus button it.","04:00","04:13",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I forget what they call that in.","04:14","04:15",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Google sheets, but.","04:15","04:16",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yep, perfect.","04:22","04:23",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So collapse that down and then let's add a column B and we can put a definition for Steve of what we do to get the data into each of these high level categories.","04:23","04:34",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So recurring would be bank account trends and or revenue source.","04:39","04:44",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Like a lot of times it's Stripe or PayPal or something like that where hey, what is the normal stripe per month?","04:44","04:50",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Seasonally adjusted.","04:50","04:52",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And like that's just little small gifts that add up.","04:53","04:56",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And some orgs can rely on that, some can't.","04:56","04:59",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"But that's a thing that sometimes exists that's more generic.","04:59","05:03",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Just looking at the data, taking some averages, maybe some trends, major gifts is where we would do one of two things.","05:03","05:14",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Base it on pledges or accounts receivable.","05:14","05:19",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And I would love to put on there a, a toggle that I would love Steve is to say we expect our AR to be received in the bank in 60 days, you know, or 40 days or whatever.","05:19","05:31",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And that's going to impact the weeks that shows up coming in as cash as a forecast.","05:31","05:36",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And those are actually named, they pull straight from the AR ledger as opposed to just bank activity and averages that make sense.","05:38","05:46",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yeah.","05:46","05:47",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And so then like even from a UI perspective I would have inflows be the only thing you see and it's got the estimated total for each week going forward for 13 weeks.","05:49","05:58",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"But you could expand that and see these two subcategories with the totals and then if you wanted to, you could expand that and get the detail beneath it.","05:58","06:05",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yep, perfect.","06:13","06:15",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Then we go down to outflows and I like the same kind of idea Matt.","06:20","06:29",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Like a generic standard outflow that's again seasonally adjusted like this what's the credit card spend and the you know, little achs that hit the bank, maybe small checks as kind of like one category.","06:29","06:43",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Then I always like payroll or compensation as another category that would include payroll, retirement, health insurance like things that recur intend to have a pretty standard amount.","06:49","07:01",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"You can usually pull that straight off again the bank account activity like it tends to be, you can see the pay cycle, you can expect pretty accurately that the next date payroll is going to pull and into the future if it's biweekly, semi monthly, weekly, all the way down to the day it actually happens.","07:02","07:22",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And then below that I would put like recurring vendors, recurring major vendors and that's a list.","07:26","07:35",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And then I would do kind of one time vendors in the recurring you could base off sometimes they might ach you regularly.","07:35","07:43",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Maybe it runs through AP as a normal bill.","07:43","07:45",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So there's kind of like a couple sources you may run into.","07:45","07:47",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Are you recording this Steve?","07:48","07:49",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"To capture all these notes I'm talking about?","07:49","07:51",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yeah, thankfully Matt was willing to provide that.","07:51","07:54",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Love it.","07:55","07:55",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Do it.","07:55","07:55",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Because I'm just going to talk a lot.","07:55","07:56",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"You can go listen back through but I think it'll, it'll help.","07:56","07:59",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Then Matt doesn't have to like rapidly type notes in the, in that column.","07:59","08:02",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And then I think you need to have a space and this is where the world gets made or broke and it's all about ui.","08:03","08:09",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"You need to have a space and a section map for like I don't know the title but like bespoke activity we know is going to happen into the future.","08:10","08:19",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Hey, I don't have a bill yet.","08:20","08:21",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I or I didn't enter the bill yet, but I know I owe this guy 50 grand next Friday.","08:22","08:26",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And so like a place where in the UI somebody could go in and put in what it is, define it, describe it, whether it's a vendor name or just a description and the week that it's going to happen and somehow to prompt them to keep that updated so it doesn't get stale and they forget it's there kind of a thing.","08:27","08:45",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So like the same on the revenue side, like a place to put in like a bespoke.","08:45","08:50",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Not something we can learn from history, not something that currently lives in the system of record, but something I know or something I expect.","08:50","08:57",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And that to me is where having that, making it clear, having an audit log on it, but being able to keep it fresh is like truly where the difference of like what everybody could do this pretty simply and why it doesn't usually work is like that tiny gap of the human knowledge that doesn't currently reside in a system of record.","08:58","09:17",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"From there again, it's pretty simple.","09:21","09:22",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"We can do a lot more beyond this Steve, as you even talked about.","09:22","09:25",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"But like if you can nail this, it's like you're tapping into the bank activity, you're tapping into ap, Arkansas and then giving a little UI to input unique stuff and it kind of makes sense.","09:25","09:41",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"The trick is like that AP Piece where some of those vendors have a bill sitting there that's already in some AP is not a normal vendor and it's going to get paid.","09:41","09:52",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So it's like being able to not double count that by looking at trends to know am I counting that twice?","09:52","09:58",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So there's a little hair on that part.","09:58","10:01",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"That's my overview.","10:09","10:10",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"You guys can talk or I can, you know, that's what that was kind of the.","10:10","10:13",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Not, not rocket science, but you know, a little bit of stuff and makes it a little hairy, a little confusing.","10:14","10:21",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And we end up doing it kind of different for different clients, but same kind of basic components.","10:21","10:25",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"This is super helpful.","10:27","10:28",0,"Steve Simpson"
"A couple questions.","10:29","10:30",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Are you the ones actually doing payroll and so your.","10:30","10:34",0,"Steve Simpson"
"You would have expectation this pool would do that too or mainly just document it as an accounts payable requirement that you would track.","10:36","10:45",0,"Steve Simpson"
"We kind of do payroll sometimes, but in general payroll is pretty steady with our clients at least.","10:54","10:58",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So it's like you just look at the trends to forecast the payroll and you know, if they're going to let somebody go or add somebody, you know, we'll kind of incorporate that and think about it a little bit.","10:58","11:07",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"But in general, yeah, payrolls just kind of based on the history.","11:07","11:16",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"But I mean, are you actively going in and executing payroll through gusto or through some other tool yourself or is this mainly just keeping accounts because you know this is going to be part of your AP.","11:18","11:30",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Usually.","11:39","11:40",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I mean sometimes we initiate it, sometimes they do.","11:40","11:42",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"In any case it sinks into QuickBooks like when it happens immediately.","11:43","11:46",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So as payrolls actually run, we know it.","11:47","11:49",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"But if I want to look out 13 weeks, it's not based on running it's based on what the trend has been.","11:49","11:55",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Sure.","11:55","11:56",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I'll circle back around to the 13 weeks part.","12:03","12:06",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Can we scroll back up to some of the.","12:07","12:09",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Thanks.","12:10","12:10",0,"Steve Simpson"
"You had mentioned that you would need to see bank feeds.","12:13","12:16",0,"Steve Simpson"
"When we talked a couple days ago, it was the sort of bank balances that were reading off of QuickBooks which only registers payments that have cleared or like transactions that have cleared.","12:16","12:31",0,"Steve Simpson"
"It wasn't necessarily a plaid feed of like pending things that are coming in.","12:32","12:38",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Is that still like how you guys run it or are you using an external source to get a couple days heads up?","12:38","12:47",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So QuickBooks bank balance is better if someone's completely on top of putting the actual bank activity into it.","12:49","13:01",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So actual activity from the bank is the most reliable.","13:02","13:05",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Sometimes that sits in a QuickBooks queue that you can't access.","13:06","13:09",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"They don't have APIs for it.","13:09","13:10",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"You can only see it after someone's transacted in it.","13:10","13:13",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"That's like their special sauce part of their tech and they don't let people tap into it.","13:13","13:16",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So if that's up to date, then if you have the QuickBooks back record, you have both all of the activity from the bank that's actually happened and everything that you put into QuickBooks that will happen into the future.","13:17","13:29",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So like that's a good source.","13:30","13:31",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"What normally happens is that's dated.","13:31","13:34",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"There's like a lag of days, weeks, a month in terms of pushing all that into QuickBooks.","13:34","13:39",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So QuickBooks now is, has a gap and the bank is a better source of data.","13:39","13:44",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"That's where like with your tool, the more it relies on people doing perfect bookkeeping every day, the less useful it becomes and the more you would want to like rely on the bank as that source of truth.","13:45","13:55",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So this is where these kinds of systems tend to get hung up and the entrepreneurs tend to just go back to looking at the bank because they can't trust the accounting system.","13:57","14:05",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And these things get cleared into the bank through the bookkeeper sort of verifying all the transactions on the bank chart of accounts.","14:08","14:17",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Is that what you're saying like that it takes a month to clear sometimes.","14:18","14:22",0,"Steve Simpson"
"It doesn't take a month to clear, it takes whenever a person goes in and clears it.","14:23","14:26",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Okay, it's there every single day.","14:26","14:28",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Like the bank and QuickBooks have the same data like within the same day almost, maybe within.","14:28","14:34",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"It probably updates by the minute.","14:34","14:35",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"At this point the it goes from the bank into this like holding queue in QuickBooks where QuickBooks tries to auto categorize, match to things that already exist.","14:35","14:44",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"It's a nice, it's a nice module.","14:44","14:46",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Most companies have somebody going into that once a month, sometimes once a week, very rarely daily.","14:47","14:56",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And then once that's been matched and pushed through, now QuickBooks in the bank are equal on everything that's happened.","14:56","15:01",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And QuickBooks then has things that will happen in the future that the bank hasn't seen yet.","15:01","15:06",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So after that process is run, QuickBooks is the best source of truth by a lot prior to that process being run.","15:06","15:14",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Bank's a better source of truth because oftentimes something's happened in the bank that QuickBooks is unaware of.","15:14","15:18",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Okay, how much is, are these sort of invoices that are coming in or bills that are going out, you catching up to credit card spend, you know, by certain officers who have that or business owners who have that.","15:20","15:39",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And so you're sort of always in a Reaction mode or are most expenses run through you for your team and so you're sort of helping them in that weekly cash call or however regularly you do this, making decisions on which bills to pay and that kind of stuff.","15:41","15:59",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Your question is, how much are we in charge of versus the client themselves?","16:03","16:07",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yeah.","16:08","16:08",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So I was talking to another CPA friend of mine, and they host a weekly cash call in which they have like, all the bills, all the invoices, and they basically walk through which bills do we want to pay?","16:08","16:19",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Who do you need to go knock on the door?","16:19","16:22",0,"Steve Simpson"
"It makes moving in terms of payment.","16:22","16:25",0,"Steve Simpson"
"It sounded like when we talked a couple days ago, maybe you guys don't have any good calls.","16:25","16:30",0,"Steve Simpson"
"But I was just thinking through that.","16:30","16:32",0,"Steve Simpson"
"What does that mean in terms of, are they just making all the transactions and you're trying to make sure that the books stay synced up in terms of like they're doing a lot of spend on credit card versus you guys are actually sort of managing invoices and making payments as bills and ap.","16:32","16:51",0,"Steve Simpson"
"For the most part, we manage it all.","16:53","16:55",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And we don't really have to have calls to talk about it unless they're running low on cash, which is a couple clients at any given time.","16:55","17:00",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"you know, we pay what's due, when it's due, they approve it.","17:01","17:05",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So, like, everything's got proper workflow, but there's not a lot of thought about that part of things.","17:05","17:10",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Okay.","17:11","17:11",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And workflow is like, you guys set up a set of thresholds or whatever, how you want to run the business, or you actually send them a list of things that they need to approve, and then that just sort of happens.","17:11","17:22",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Async.","17:22","17:23",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah, that all runs through RAMP for us, if you've seen Ramp.","17:23","17:26",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So the bill gets uploaded, a vision model extracts everything, tries to code it.","17:27","17:31",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"We have somebody offshore that actually codes it.","17:32","17:34",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Everything's then routed for approval based on that client's preferences.","17:35","17:38",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So the bill comes in, we own getting it into the system, it goes and sits with one of them to approve that it should be paid, maybe a sequence of them based on who the vendor is, how much money is there, etc.","17:38","17:49",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"It Ultimately then, once approved, it goes to be paid on the due date, you know, or whatever.","17:49","17:55",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"There's.","17:55","17:56",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"We could say pay it five days early.","17:56","17:57",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"We could, you know, but we set that as a setting in the system and that just runs.","17:57","18:01",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"It pushes into QuickBooks, tells us all that.","18:01","18:04",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So that whole piece is super automated, no meeting needed.","18:05","18:09",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Really pretty slick.","18:09","18:10",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Related to that.","18:12","18:12",0,"Steve Simpson"
"How.","18:12","18:13",0,"Steve Simpson"
"How then would you see this Tool interacting like with a ramp in terms of responsibilities or jobs to be done.","18:13","18:20",0,"Steve Simpson"
"If like a lot of firms are using RAMP now to manage the just like bill ingestion and turn it into something that needs to be paid and then have some policies wrapped around it, do you view this tool actually potentially owning that experience?","18:21","18:36",0,"Steve Simpson"
"If people don't want to, they don't need all the permissions, workflow that ramp provides, things like that.","18:36","18:42",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Are you saying use it in place of ramp?","18:45","18:47",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yeah.","18:48","18:48",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I don't think it.","18:53","18:53",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I mean I think it would cost a hundred million dollars to use it in place of ramp.","18:53","18:58",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I think with that said, you know the thing that happens in ramp is it's going to auto approve things to pay ramps, not paying attention to how.","18:59","19:05",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Much cash you actually have.","19:05","19:06",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So this tool is almost a check of should we stop that from being thing, should we add an approval step if we're low on cash or we forecast into the future that cash is low.","19:08","19:18",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So like ramp's not taking those things into account?","19:18","19:20",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I wouldn't.","19:21","19:22",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I think the workflow for what gets paid like ramp's doing an important thing of here's something I owe, is it coded correctly?","19:22","19:29",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Second is it approved appropriately?","19:30","19:32",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And then the third piece that RAMP doesn't really think about is do I have the money to pay it?","19:33","19:36",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"This to me tells me, do I have the money to pay it?","19:37","19:39",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"But those other things are critically important, really hard to do, and ramp does it really well.","19:40","19:43",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So I think for clients where CACHE is an issue, the two systems would be working in conjunction to some extent.","19:44","19:51",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And more importantly, your system simply needs to ramp and QuickBooks have the deep connectivity.","19:53","19:58",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"You probably don't need to worry about getting ramp connectivity.","19:58","20:01",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"As long as you have QuickBooks access, you'll see everything that's going on in ramp.","20:01","20:06",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Okay, yeah.","20:09","20:12",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So if all approvals are happening through ramp, then my system, let's say if we check that there isn't enough cache, would have to be like the last block, not blocker, but like a secondary layer of APprovals that's more about cache Runway than it is about is this the right vendor, is this the right amount, is this the right time?","20:12","20:36",0,"Steve Simpson"
"That kind of stuff.","20:36","20:37",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Correct?","20:39","20:39",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yep, exactly.","20:39","20:40",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yours is simply saying based on all this information from ap, AR and bank, how much cash do I have today, how much will I have at the end of the week, how much will I have at the end of next week, the week after, etc.","20:41","20:53",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Nobody's really synthesizing all those things at.","20:53","20:55",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"This point very well.","20:55","20:57",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Okay.","20:58","20:58",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Anything on the AR side, I know we have maybe eight minutes left.","21:00","21:04",0,"Steve Simpson"
"It seems like at least for your client base, they're doing a good chunk of regular stuff through Stripe which has a good API.","21:07","21:16",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Major bills are coming in through checks and stuff like that or major gifts.","21:18","21:22",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Like you don't have vendors like I was originally targeting professional services so they might be doing a book of work, sending out an invoice, waiting 45 days to get paid.","21:27","21:39",0,"Steve Simpson"
"There's a lot of, you know, things around reminding people kind of like how i1 does their collection stuff.","21:40","21:47",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah, yeah.","21:47","21:48",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"In general QuickBooks so some, you know, companies are using like a donor management system or in the for profit space, you know, in a point of sale or a crM or ERP that's doing invoicing for some specific stuff.","21:49","22:08",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Most use cases these days, QuickBooks is actually that system and it actually has a lot of that at this point.","22:09","22:15",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"It has pretty smart ar, it has reminders, it has so it again, I don't know that's a space that is as ripe or needy.","22:15","22:24",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"But I do think the synthesis between it all is pretty interesting.","22:24","22:27",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And it's something that when I think about selling to accountants, selling them a tool for 10 or $15 a month is interesting but selling them the ability to sell a service to a client for an extra 500 or thousand a month is worth a lot more to them if you automate it.","22:27","22:44",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So if you can take this, turn it into a really sharp email or PDF or UI or both and it auto send but it looks like a human put a lot of thought into like what these steps are.","22:45","22:58",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"That's a high value.","22:59","23:00",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Like you're actually automating advisory anyway.","23:00","23:04",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So AR and collection stuff is great.","23:04","23:06",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"It just, I think that's a more solved problem than this thing we're talking about here.","23:06","23:10",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Not do it but it's just QuickBooks does it pretty well and I think they'll continue to do it better over time.","23:11","23:17",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Agreed.","23:18","23:18",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I mainly was thinking of in terms of how well you do AR and how well you do AP actually controls the accordion.","23:18","23:25",0,"Steve Simpson"
"How much cash you have on hand or what levers do you have access to?","23:25","23:29",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So I wasn't quite sure they expose APIs for that.","23:29","23:34",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So whether that was part of the secret sauce of not just can they do it but can you give more dials inside of this tool in order to make QuickBooks seeing how you want it to sing.","23:34","23:49",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Got it.","23:49","23:50",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yeah.","23:51","23:52",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"There's potentially something there I'd have to look at that use case more.","23:52","23:57",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Okay, last five minutes or so.","23:58","24:02",0,"Steve Simpson"
"What kind of experience are you thinking?","24:03","24:05",0,"Steve Simpson"
"You guys have done a really great job showing me sort of the core parts in a spreadsheet format.","24:05","24:11",0,"Steve Simpson"
"To what degree do you feel like the UI experience people would want to work through Dashboard kind of seeing where my clients at, maybe any given client.","24:13","24:26",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I want to be able to see sort of the main quick hits that their current state is and then sort of like action space of like what can I do about that?","24:26","24:36",0,"Steve Simpson"
"You had just mentioned like you would love to see that automated but I'm imagining people will also want to sort of let the product earn that level of trust by having a phase where they still get to do stuff and then eventually it becomes more settings oriented or intelligence oriented.","24:37","24:55",0,"Steve Simpson"
"What would be like magic wand.","24:57","24:58",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I would love to see this as the experience I use to handle this part of my job.","24:58","25:03",0,"Steve Simpson"
"What do you think Matt?","25:05","25:06",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Dashboard with different where cash is at future points, low watermark between those points and then expandable to see what it's assuming to make sure it's making the right assumptions in between those high level points.","25:08","25:22",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Like I want to see where we're at the end of the month, I want to see where we're at in three months.","25:22","25:26",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"I want to know what the lowest bank balance might be projected during that time.","25:26","25:31",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"But I also want to expand and see everything that makes that up and make sure it's assuming correctly.","25:31","25:37",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So collapse at the highest level but expand to look in at those different points in time.","25:39","25:44",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Kind of how I see it.","25:46","25:47",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yeah, I think that, that makes sense to me.","25:52","25:55",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And you could feed this into a spreadsheet as the original ui.","25:55","25:59",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I think it's better to be something simpler, more like an application.","25:59","26:03",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"But we've actually been pretty successful with things that do just go in directly as you know, as into Google Sheets and take clients through it.","26:03","26:16",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"It also kind of works.","26:16","26:18",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So if that's a simpler form factor to build it in a spreadsheet and make the connections and have it stay live like that's actually been pretty good.","26:18","26:26",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Ultimately making it a more user friendly simple UI could make sense but I don't think that would be table stakes.","26:26","26:32",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"To start would be my take is.","26:32","26:35",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"This a little bit more like float and other tools that are doing 13 week projections and it goes a little bit further back in where you can actually put some controls around what ramp is doing.","26:35","26:52",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I think that's like a different solution than I was thinking but you know, definitely need to learn what the customer actually expects.","26:53","27:01",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I don't know, I haven't seen float.","27:03","27:05",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"We've got.","27:06","27:06",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Then we've got live flow.","27:07","27:09",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So we haven't dug in to see.","27:11","27:12",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"You know, it wouldn't surprise me if something kind of like this exists.","27:12","27:15",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"We in the last time we've kind of peaked for it, haven't found something great.","27:15","27:18",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So we've.","27:18","27:19",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"It's always missed something we needed so we just stuck with spreadsheets.","27:19","27:22",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"But it could be something out there.","27:24","27:25",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Well, I think that those products really double down on the 13 week forecast around assumptions and seasonality adjustment, things like that.","27:26","27:35",0,"Steve Simpson"
"But I don't think they actually do any operational.","27:35","27:38",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Pay this bill, don't pay that bill.","27:38","27:40",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Block ramp.","27:40","27:41",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Here's, here's knobs that you can twist on ar, this is a live bank feed, that kind of stuff.","27:41","27:50",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I think it's more like smart analytics.","27:50","27:54",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Got it, got it.","27:55","27:56",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So you're envisioning once you see what shows up here, you can actually take actions and have it push it back to say pay this bill at a later date or send a reminder to this open ar.","27:57","28:09",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Is that what you're seeing in yours?","28:10","28:12",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I mean I know that QuickBooks on the AR side has stuff and on the AP side and there's ramp.","28:14","28:20",0,"Steve Simpson"
"But yeah, if I'm going to bring it all together, my thought was don't make you then go right back to QuickBooks and after you've made the decisions then enact the decisions in QuickBooks.","28:20","28:30",0,"Steve Simpson"
"You should have a surface to see where you're at, prioritize what you want to do and approve that batch set of decisions.","28:31","28:39",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Either talking it through with the client in a call so they can see with you or if you already have settings and policies, you understand the business, you're tuning those policies and you don't have to sort of decide in one place and do in another kind of a single surface.","28:40","28:57",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Got it, got it.","28:57","28:58",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Interesting.","28:59","28:59",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"That makes.","29:00","29:01",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I'd have to see what that looks like.","29:05","29:07",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Just the number of places you just do things starts to become a sprawl as well, you know, so having like a snapshot of what's happened but knowing I do this here is.","29:11","29:21",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Is nice.","29:21","29:22",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"The things like a keeper to your point that are starting to say do everything here, they're not quite there.","29:22","29:27",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Like okay that's interesting but that's where you can do journal entries, you can code your transaction.","29:27","29:33",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"You know, like it's.","29:33","29:34",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"It's like you have to really if you're gonna go single pane of glass or place to do something you got to really do a lot of the things in.","29:34","29:41",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So anyway, I would just be thoughtful about that, about adding a place to take an action.","29:42","29:46",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"You know, I may start with showing what actions you may want to take and let them do that still in the systems.","29:47","29:53",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And then, you know, maybe figure out what.","29:53","29:55",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"What are the things that are most useful to just do right then and there.","29:55","29:58",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So again, haven't thought about it that way.","29:58","29:59",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"It's a good.","29:59","30:00",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"It's a cool perspective.","30:00","30:00",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I just.","30:00","30:01",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I don't have enough of an opinion at this point.","30:01","30:03",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yeah.","30:03","30:04",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And I know we're running out of time.","30:09","30:10",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I'm trying to not be just one more pain.","30:11","30:13",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And if there's already reports, you can pull in QuickBooks.","30:14","30:17",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I'd rather not be analytics.","30:17","30:18",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I'd rather be action.","30:18","30:20",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So a real painkiller rather than observation on pain.","30:20","30:23",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I've already gone through in my other tools.","30:23","30:25",0,"Steve Simpson"
"But you're right, it is a lot more responsibility to be the actor, not just the observer.","30:26","30:31",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And this is good pushback.","30:32","30:34",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I think there's a lot of value in being the observer and the summarizer.","30:35","30:38",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I think, like, that's what a client are looking for in.","30:38","30:40",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"From the advisory standpoint, like in the actions piece.","30:40","30:44",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Like, is.","30:44","30:45",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Sometimes that just gets really hard and messy.","30:45","30:48",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"A lot of.","30:49","30:49",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Yes.","30:49","30:50",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"It's just.","30:50","30:50",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"There's not so much we can do that's like.","30:50","30:52",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"That's like the business.","30:52","30:52",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Can I tell this vendor?","30:53","30:54",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"No, you got to do it later.","30:54","30:55",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Can I call this customer and get them to pay tomorrow?","30:55","30:58",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"Like, the automated things are nice, but they really don't move.","30:58","31:01",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"What actually has to happen, like this is still accounting and finance forecasting, but it's not operating the business.","31:01","31:07",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"So that may be worth.","31:07","31:13",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"And I got to jump.","31:13","31:14",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I got a call coming in that I need to jump to, but anyway, Steve, good catching up.","31:14","31:16",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"You guys want to keep going, go for it.","31:16","31:17",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"We'll be in touch.","31:18","31:19",2,"Levi Morehouse"
"I really appreciate it.","31:21","31:22",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I'm not sure what would be steps to get the recording and the transcripts, but it seems like you have an automated service for that.","31:22","31:29",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah, I'll share over there a video recording and I can share over the transcript recording too, which basically be the same.","31:30","31:37",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"I did share the spreadsheet were looking at, so you can have that for reference as well.","31:37","31:41",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"But yeah, I guess let us know.","31:41","31:44",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"A lot of interesting points from both of you.","31:45","31:47",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So I'm not sure what the next direction is, but happy to talk more if you want to bounce things later.","31:47","31:53",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yeah, I mean, you know, apologize.","31:53","31:56",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Didn't really get a chance to know you or get your perspective.","31:56","32:00",0,"Steve Simpson"
"But I would.","32:00","32:02",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah, I continue to love to learn from you as well.","32:02","32:04",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Any initial thoughts on that?","32:04","32:07",0,"Steve Simpson"
"You know, observe and forecasting more than actually doing, kind of bringing it all together into one service.","32:07","32:15",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Any perspective there?","32:15","32:16",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I feel like there's maybe a difference in responsibility between the person that raises the flag on a potential upcoming issue and the person that takes the action and their level of competency between the two.","32:21","32:39",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Like, we're often hired on to advise on things that they're not strong in, but they may need to go take the action, do the thing.","32:39","32:47",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So there's a disconnect between who's using the software and who's taking the next step based on what.","32:47","32:52",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"What kind of the software shows, if that makes sense.","32:53","32:56",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yeah.","32:57","32:57",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So can I clarify that a little bit?","32:58","33:00",0,"Steve Simpson"
"You're brought in mainly in an advisory role and they have internal finance people who are, you know, actually doing the books, paying bills, that kind of stuff.","33:00","33:10",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So in our situation, a lot of times we are, they're outsourced accounting.","33:11","33:15",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"They have a, they sometimes have a CFO person and then that person's just very high level and that's.","33:16","33:22",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"They might be the one taking the action.","33:23","33:24",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"A lot of cases like moving money or changing investment vehicles or whatever, or it's us paired with just a general operations team or they have a development team which is like sales basically for nonprofits.","33:24","33:40",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"And that person might be the one that picks up the phone calls, the person that said they're going to give money and typically not us.","33:41","33:49",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So there's like a disconnect there between who.","33:49","33:52",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"The.","33:52","33:52",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Who is actually going to make contact versus who's just raising the flag that something is amiss.","33:52","33:57",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So.","34:00","34:00",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And your team specializes within the nonprofit space.","34:00","34:04",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And that's why every time you try to do like outreach to get paid, it's actually probably more of a human relationship.","34:04","34:12",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah, exactly.","34:12","34:13",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"You can't just submit an invoice and send a reminder.","34:13","34:17",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Correct?","34:17","34:18",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yeah.","34:18","34:18",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Like they're nurturing a relationship for a donor that's giving a million dollars.","34:18","34:24",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Like they don't want to hear from us, they want to hear from that person.","34:24","34:26",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Right, right.","34:27","34:28",0,"Steve Simpson"
"If my core client base wouldn't be in the nonprofit space, but in the for profit space.","34:30","34:36",0,"Steve Simpson"
"How much of what I had described that there's a, you know, originally targeting professional services, IT consulting agencies, that kind of stuff.","34:37","34:50",0,"Steve Simpson"
"An owner who does kind of want.","34:50","34:52",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And so this is me sourcing my other Casper and friends.","34:53","34:57",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And they are actually the ones kind of talking the owner through who to pay, who to call.","34:57","35:01",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And so it is like an active dashboard that they actually do want to push a button to make it happen.","35:02","35:08",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So it's interesting here in this role with an active CFO who's doing this.","35:10","35:16",0,"Steve Simpson"
"That's a good layering for me to remember that potentially there needs to be like a observer experience empowering an advisory firm who's still, you know, needs that other people to do most of it.","35:16","35:32",0,"Steve Simpson"
"They would be doing it in QuickBooks directly, is that correct?","35:32","35:35",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Doing like pay bills.","35:40","35:42",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Like I said, or what Levi said?","35:45","35:47",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"For the most part, most of our clients are using an outsourced payment system like ramp or bill.com or something like that, which is just feeding into QuickBooks as the source of record.","35:47","35:58",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"I'm sure small businesses are using the bill Pay product and QuickBooks and everything, all the bells and whistles.","36:01","36:06",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"But we have better experience with some of the third party tools.","36:06","36:09",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yeah, I've heard that Bill is pretty terrible.","36:11","36:13",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Bill pays maybe what the bookkeeper does if they're outsourcing for a client.","36:14","36:21",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And Ramp is really popular.","36:22","36:24",0,"Steve Simpson"
"But I didn't know to what degree.","36:24","36:25",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Most of the size companies you're targeting or I'm targeting need lots of layers of approval.","36:26","36:32",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And whether Ramp was overkill for the Fortune 500, it is exactly super powerful.","36:32","36:40",0,"Steve Simpson"
"But maybe at least the layer I was thinking of if that it might be like an ergonomically attractive solution that most firms want to use for all their clients.","36:40","36:52",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Are you saying that all the tools that you use basically happen based on what the clients are using and you just like absorb it and use it?","36:53","37:01",0,"Steve Simpson"
"No, we pretty actively push clients towards a certain stack like we want them in ramp.","37:04","37:09",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"We've migrated 83% of our clients there now off from Bill, off from these other systems that are pretty archaic now.","37:09","37:18",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"But I could see small businesses not needing that.","37:20","37:23",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Like nonprofits have more compliance that we need to run through approval systems with audit logs and have all the documentation and user input.","37:23","37:32",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So I can see in your other scenarios where QuickBooks bill pay or bill pay through the bank might be a more popular option just because that's where they're operating at without those needs for extra approvals and audit logs.","37:32","37:46",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So when you do advising on like which bills to pay, that's because you've already entered it into Ramp as well.","37:47","37:54",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah.","37:56","37:57",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So if someone's in a cash crunch, we're usually taking a little different approach where we will change the workflow so that there's an either an extra approval step so the fund can't be automatically released or we change it so that you have to manually select which ones to pay.","37:57","38:18",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"And then at that point we're deciding with the client who should get paid, who should be communicated with, that they're not going to get paid and when.","38:18","38:26",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"But yeah, it's more of a what should we pay?","38:28","38:31",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"And then hold the rest and making that decision with them.","38:31","38:35",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"But we need to have that conversation ahead of time, which is where a forecasting tool is obviously helpful.","38:35","38:40",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So just to play that through, how would my tool get a read on which bills need to be prioritized if all your bill pay goes into ramp?","38:41","38:50",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Right.","38:53","38:53",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So when a bill goes into ramp, it Syncs immediately to QuickBooks.","38:53","38:58",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So we'll be sitting in QuickBooks.","38:58","39:00",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Okay.","39:00","39:01",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Starting to reveal like how much.","39:02","39:04",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I'm not a cpa.","39:04","39:05",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I beside lots of them as a data scientist, analyst and ML person.","39:06","39:12",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So I think in terms of like data.","39:12","39:14",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Data products.","39:14","39:15",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So for me this is like solutioning a data product.","39:16","39:18",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah, a lot of that information is going to feed in pretty real time to QuickBooks.","39:20","39:25",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"That's why, you know, if you have to tap into one system, that's the system for most cases.","39:25","39:30",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"And then in that case of like, hey, this doesn't.","39:32","39:34",0,"Steve Simpson"
"We don't even have the cash.","39:35","39:36",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Would you then put a stop before you even go get approvals or should you wait for cash before you go through or just go ahead and get all the necessary approvals and then sort of put a guardrail threshold until we have sufficient cash this can be finalized?","39:38","39:53",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah, we usually run it through approvals and just put a stop step in there somewhere where someone doesn't approve until we've all decided that is a bill we will pay.","39:55","40:05",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Or just not manually releasing anything.","40:06","40:09",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"But we'll usually run it through so that when we do want to pay it, like it's ready to go, we don't have to wait a week for someone that's on vacation to approve it or something.","40:10","40:19",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Weird.","40:19","40:19",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So the tool I pitched would be like the decision tool that would then tell you what to go into ramp and release.","40:21","40:31",0,"Steve Simpson"
"If you know what I pitched is really what you guys need.","40:32","40:36",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah, I think we're looking for.","40:38","40:40",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Early.","40:43","40:44",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Alert systems that there is a problem on the horizon that funding is not sufficient enough to cover future spend or future spending trends.","40:44","40:53",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"and then next level could be these are the important things that we cannot not spend on.","40:53","41:02",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Or these are our recurring vendors that we need to keep relationships with.","41:02","41:06",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Like, I don't know what that step looks like, but it's first identifying there's a problem to begin with.","41:06","41:12",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Is there this concept in you guys mind that all right, we have let's say $100,000 in the bank and we know that in the next 30, 45 days that we'll be spending need to spend 125 just to keep the numbers round.","41:14","41:33",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And so you go ahead and earmark the indispensably.","41:34","41:38",0,"Steve Simpson"
"We have to say that we've already covered these.","41:38","41:40",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And then sort of as the next layer of cash comes in, then we start to basically prioritizing your AP and already sort of just like kind of gapping current balance versus available balance on.","41:40","41:55",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Thank goodness I have my rent paid for, I have payroll covered and I'm going to pretend like I don't have that money anymore, even though I can wait technically you know, 12 more days to release the funds.","41:56","42:08",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah, like there was a client earlier this year, late last year where we had to go through a process of these are tier one vendors.","42:09","42:17",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"There's a tier two, these are tier three.","42:17","42:19",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"We're gonna pay the tier one.","42:20","42:21",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Like that's usually payroll.","42:21","42:23",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Like you gotta keep your people for the most part.","42:23","42:25",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"You can't break your lease.","42:25","42:27",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Lease might get negotiated but like there's just things you have to pay.","42:28","42:33",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Then there's tier two.","42:33","42:34",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"These are like our key contractors or key outside vendors that we really want to keep as a long term relationship.","42:34","42:40",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"When we have extra money, let's pay them, let's communicate to them that we're having issues but we want to keep them.","42:40","42:45",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"And then tier three are the ones like sorry, we can't pay you for six months.","42:45","42:49",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Like we'll come up with a payment plan but kind of compartmentalizing those different ones and then trying to figure out what we need to raise to pay off or what we need to do to make things last until the next payday, next big grant or something.","42:49","43:06",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Okay.","43:07","43:07",0,"Steve Simpson"
"If you were to modularize or tier this product, we've kind of looked at a spreadsheet that could represent the core original of just like every week, every two weeks.","43:08","43:22",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I mean, I don't know how often you guys do it or think through it given that it sounds like you have a fairly well automated system.","43:22","43:30",0,"Steve Simpson"
"But you know, if you were going to say like core rituals is C100 what's coming in and how much I have in the bank next levels, you know, is it smarter ap?","43:30","43:41",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I guess now I'm trying to think this new gap of being mainly an observer, not an Actor.","43:43","43:47",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And I really thought like, what do you have to build to keep people out of QuickBooks?","43:49","43:53",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So they feel like the QuickBooks for the compliant side of bookkeeping and tax.","43:53","43:59",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And I just need a decision of like they're already working out of a sauna.","43:59","44:03",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I just want more, one more place.","44:03","44:04",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Originally I was thinking this would be a tool for the owners to like, you know, just help me think my cash decisions a little bit smarter than the bank account.","44:05","44:14",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Now thinking from the advisor side, maybe there's more layers.","44:15","44:20",0,"Steve Simpson"
"But like I hadn't really thought about the sports.","44:20","44:27",0,"Steve Simpson"
"The 13 week forecasting that seemed like it's its own special tool.","44:27","44:32",0,"Steve Simpson"
"There's a couple players out there doing that.","44:32","44:34",0,"Steve Simpson"
"You know, that's why I was thinking like you actually just make the bill pay decisions and run the invoices down.","44:36","44:43",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Sorry to be thinking this out loud.","44:43","44:45",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I mean, what would you pay for?","44:48","44:49",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Just more of an observer experience.","44:49","44:51",0,"Steve Simpson"
"It does sound like you can sell.","44:51","44:52",0,"Steve Simpson"
"You're thinking of selling this as an advisory.","44:53","44:55",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So this like a value add perspective.","44:55","44:57",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So I wasn't thinking as much on the advisory side.","44:59","45:01",0,"Steve Simpson"
"More of the outsourced accounting.","45:01","45:04",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah.","45:06","45:07",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So we operate in this niche of nonprofits where it's not like some guy running a law firm and has billable hours and kind of has a consistent inflow and consistent outflows.","45:07","45:21",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"A non profit might be, hey, we need to go solicit a million dollars this year.","45:22","45:26",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"We're operating at like three months at a time.","45:27","45:30",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Like that's all the cash reserve we have.","45:30","45:32",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"We have to keep it going.","45:32","45:33",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"It's more important for nonprofits.","45:35","45:37",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Like every year they got to get a budget approved.","45:37","45:39",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Every year we're reporting against it.","45:40","45:42",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"People that are uncertain about their future want forecasting.","45:43","45:46",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So like they want to project.","45:47","45:48",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Okay, we've got this in staffing.","45:48","45:52",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"We're going to consider doing this program.","45:52","45:55",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"We need to hire one person.","45:55","45:56",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"What does that do to our forecast for the rest of the year?","45:56","45:59",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So there's like playing with variables as part of the forecasting, but just having a general, a tool that looks at QuickBooks, all the inputs in there, identifies trends for certain vendors that are always $20 a month.","46:00","46:15",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Like you can push that out, forecast that into the future.","46:15","46:18",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Payroll is always a trend, puts that into the future and you kind of look ahead to see where you're at.","46:19","46:26",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"But then there's the question of I want to do this.","46:26","46:28",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"How does that affect what we had originally budgeted, which is now the forecast when we're looking ahead like that.","46:28","46:34",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So, so we're getting involved in a lot more budgeting and forecasting then like the for profit sectors you're looking at because they're like they've got more of a recurring business.","46:35","46:48",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Mrr.","46:49","46:49",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Sorry.","46:50","46:51",0,"Steve Simpson"
"This was the tool I was referencing earlier.","46:51","46:54",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I think it's built on top of QuickBooks.","46:56","46:59",0,"Steve Simpson"
"QuickBooks just released their own forecasting module.","46:59","47:03",0,"Steve Simpson"
"It's supposed to be for that competitor to the this in this sense, I don't think there's any sort of actions taken.","47:03","47:10",0,"Steve Simpson"
"It's more like the trend lines, gaps, assumptions, that kind of stuff.","47:10","47:13",0,"Steve Simpson"
"And I think you said you had done Fathom, which I guess is kind of QuickBooks's internal like analytics that they released as its own company.","47:15","47:30",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Is that true?","47:33","47:34",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Not the background like you use this tool for like basic reporting.","47:34","47:38",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Oh, sorry to switch over.","47:39","47:41",0,"Steve Simpson"
"So I haven't seen Float before, but we do have some use with Fathom when we've looked at tools in the past.","47:42","47:51",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"The pieces that are missing is being able to input changes like future scenarios, but also making it easy for clients to do it as well.","47:51","48:02",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So that's where we usually end up in spreadsheets, walking them through on a spreadsheet, asking them to input manual numbers like on the spreadsheet I shared with you to kind of get us because they have information we don't have about their relationships with their major donors and stuff like that we need to account for, which you can't see in the trends and QuickBooks, which a lot of these tools are not helpful with us for that because we need those chunky pieces that aren't represented in the history.","48:02","48:31",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yeah, I can imagine.","48:35","48:36",0,"Steve Simpson"
"The questions I was going to ask is like how are you getting stray invoices or bills into QuickBooks?","48:37","48:45",0,"Steve Simpson"
"But it sounds like yours is even more intense, that it's like all ephemeral, it's all an email.","48:45","48:50",0,"Steve Simpson"
"It's, you know, it's all.","48:50","48:51",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah, well, you have given me so much extra time and I really appreciate it.","48:53","49:00",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I. I don't want to take advantage of it.","49:00","49:03",0,"Steve Simpson"
"But, you know, any parting words of wisdom, you know, to tide me over for the next couple weeks, months.","49:03","49:10",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I'm not sure actually like what kind of cadence you'd like to follow up on, but one, thank you and two, every conversation super instructive.","49:10","49:19",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Yeah, no, I think what you're working on, I don't know what is out there compared to you.","49:21","49:28",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"I didn't know about Float.","49:28","49:30",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So there's some gaps maybe in our knowledge of tools that are maybe doing some of the things that were looking for, which is helpful, but maybe not solving the same problem.","49:30","49:40",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"So interested to see where you go with this, but yeah, hard for me to say anything more without like a initial kind of mock up of where you end up going between the two the options and CPA sides you have here.","49:40","49:56",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Yeah, it does sound like there's very two different needs that we're discovering.","49:57","50:01",0,"Steve Simpson"
"I would check out like QuickBooks has supposedly upgraded their cash flow forecasting in response to several apps building on top of Rome and doing fairly well it seems.","50:01","50:13",0,"Steve Simpson"
"But Float also seems to be like top brand around this forecast.","50:13","50:18",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Well Matt, thanks so much man.","50:21","50:23",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Have a great Friday and look forward to talking again sometime soon.","50:23","50:27",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Awesome.","50:28","50:28",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Thanks Steve.","50:28","50:29",1,"Matt Yonkman"
"Thank you.","50:29","50:30",0,"Steve Simpson"
"Ciao.","50:30","50:30",0,"Steve Simpson"

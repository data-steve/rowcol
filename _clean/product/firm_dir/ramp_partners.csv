Ignite Spot Accounting,Silver,,0,"Ignite Spot was born for a specific reason: to make businesses profitable. In 2007, our founder and CEO, Eddy Hood, was working as an auditor for a local CPA firm here in Salt Lake City, Utah. On one particularly stubborn day, he had to inform a business owner that his cash balance was $50,000 off. The cause: his bookkeeper had made a mistake and had tried to cover it up with a series of journal entries. That one piece of news brought the entrepreneur to his knees. It was devastating. Eddy quit his job the very next day. No joke. He had no clients to drive revenue. What he did have was a belief that CEOs needed more than what the accounting world could give them. Here’s the problem: accounting doesn’t work. It’s useless. Most CEOs are running as fast as they can in one direction and the accountant is scrambling behind them trying to pick up the pieces. It’s a nightmare for the CEO who has no idea of where he or she stands financially. Most CEOs have given up on their accounting departments. In their minds, the accountant is someone who pushes paper and tries to come up with reports that are 30 to 60 days late. Most people have an accountant because they know they should, not because they’re getting something valuable out of the relationship. This gap between the CEO and the accountant is what we’re targeting. We want to close it. Completely. To make a business profitable, bookkeeping, tax and coaching have to work together.

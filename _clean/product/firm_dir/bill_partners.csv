Ignite Spot Accounting,Platinum Partner,"Ignite Spot was born for a specific reason: to make businesses profitable. In 2007, our founder and CEO, Eddy Hood, was working as an auditor for a local CPA firm here in Salt Lake City, Utah. On one particularly stubborn day, he had to inform a business owner that his cash balance was $50,000 off. The cause: his bookkeeper had made a mistake and had tried to cover it up with a series of journal entries. That one piece of news brought the entrepreneur to his knees. It was devastating. Eddy quit his job the very next day. No joke. He had no clients to drive revenue. What he did have was a belief that CEOs needed more than what the accounting world could give them. Here’s the problem: accounting doesn’t work. It’s useless. Most CEOs are running as fast as they can in one direction and the accountant is scrambling behind them trying to pick up the pieces. It’s a nightmare for the CEO who has no idea of where he or she stands financially. Most CEOs have given up on their accounting departments. In their minds, the accountant is someone who pushes paper and tries to come up with reports that are 30 to 60 days late. Most people have an accountant because they know they should, not because they’re getting something valuable out of the relationship. This gap between the CEO and the accountant is what we’re targeting. We want to close it. Completely. To make a business profitable, bookkeeping, tax and coaching have to work together. To date, we have served as the small business accounting firm for over 1,000 companies.",https://accountants.bill.com/find-an-accountant/ignite-spot-accounting,2.73,0.0,0.0,0.36,0.36,2,,,,275,,,bookkeeping,Not Analyzed,

"KraftCPAs, PLLC",Gold Partner,"KraftCPAs PLLC is one of the largest certified public accounting firms in Tennessee with more than 200 employees and offices in Nashville, Chattanooga, Columbia, and Lebanon. For entrepreneurs, we’re a multi-faceted partner through every phase of business ownership — from start-up to succession — with support in accounting, bookkeeping, audit and assurance, cost-savings analysis, valuation, and succession issues. We help crunch numbers and cut through red tape so business owners can focus on customers and sales. When you dreamed of owning your own business, you likely had a lifestyle in mind. And it probably didn’t involve debits, credits, payroll, and taxes. No doubt, accounting and tax work can take the fun out of owning a business. Plus, these time-consuming activities can distract owners from core business functions like product development, sales, and customer service. Since 1958, we’ve been helping entrepreneurs and established business owners in the creation and preservation of business value and personal wealth. KraftCPAs has a professional staff that is devoted to small businesses — those companies that are owner-operated — whether they are start-ups with big plans for the future or mature businesses that provide the autonomy and lifestyle that many small business owners desire. We serve both types of entrepreneurs — those who plan to operate their business for life and others who plan to grow rapidly and monetize their investment. Our goal is not only to keep you out of trouble with the IRS, but also to help you achieve your business and personal financial goals, so you can still do the things you love and enjoy owning a business. Clients of all shapes and sizes, from sole proprietors to multi-million dollar businesses, rely on our entrepreneurial services team for accounting, tax, and business advice. We develop a service plan that meets each client’s needs and budget. Outsourcing is the smart and cost-effective way to get top quality accounting and tax work without adding employees to the payroll. Our services, which range from the basics to specialized engagements, include: • Maintaining accounts payable • Maintaining general ledger and journals • Preparing budgets, cash projections, and forecasts • Adjusting and closing the books • Training or assisting your internal staff with accounting procedures and software • Establishing accounting policies and procedures • Preparing individual and business tax returns • Advising on planning and management matters",https://accountants.bill.com/find-an-accountant/kraftcpas-pllc,2.03,0.26,0.26,0.26,0.26,1,SaaS/Software,,,389,software,api,bookkeeping,Not Analyzed,

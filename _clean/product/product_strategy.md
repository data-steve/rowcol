# RowCol — The Financial Control Plane for CAS 2.0 Firms

*Version 4.0 — Multi-Rail Financial Control Plane for Advisor-Led Cash Discipline*

## **Executive Summary**

**Positioning**: A Financial Control Plane for CAS 2.0 firms, governing multi-client cash flow with advisor-grade trust through a streamlined verification loop.

**Promise**: Approve once, verify outcomes, and prove cash discipline across 20–100 clients—without spreadsheets.

**Tagline**: *Govern cash, at firm scale.*

## **What is RowCol?**

RowCol productizes **cash discipline** as a **Financial Control Plane**, orchestrating the multi-rail stack that CAS 2.0 firms have already adopted: QuickBooks Online (ledger), Ramp (A/P execution), Plaid (cash verification), and Stripe (A/R insights). Unlike passive dashboards or single-client tools, it enables advisors to:

- **Govern**: Approve payments with liquidity guardrails (e.g., 14-day buffer)
- **Verify**: Confirm execution and sync outcomes across rails  
- **Prove**: Deliver branded digests to justify client retainers

**The Win**: Save 30+ minutes/client/week, govern 50%+ of bills via RowCol, eliminate spreadsheets by week 3, and strengthen client trust with proactive deliverables.

**Key Insight**: RowCol isn't selling a new workflow—it's automating the multi-rail orchestration that CAS 2.0 firms were forced to build manually. RowCol operates as a **Financial Control Plane** with a dual-hub model: **RowCol (operational hub)** orchestrates all financial operations from the advisor's perspective, while **QBO (ledger hub)** serves as the source of truth for GAAP-compliant data. The rails (**Ramp, Plaid, Stripe**) execute, verify, and provide insights as directed by RowCol, making multi-client cash discipline feel simple and powerful.

## **Why CAS 2.0 Needs a Control Plane**

CAS 2.0 firms—advisors managing 20–100 SMB clients ($1-5M revenue, 10-30 staff)—face unique challenges in scaling strategic advisory:

- **Siloed Rails**: QBO (ledger), Ramp (A/P), Plaid (cash), and Stripe (A/R) require manual spreadsheet aggregation, unscalable past 20-30 clients
- **Time Drain**: Weekly "Friday cash checks" take 30–45 minutes/client, limiting advisory capacity
- **Cash Flow Risks**: 82% of SMB failures stem from cash flow issues; advisors must prevent payroll misses and crunches
- **Client Trust**: Advisors need branded deliverables to prove proactive governance and justify $5k-$10k/month retainers

**Market Validation**: Mid-market firms using all-in-one finance tools save hours weekly on cash discipline, proving demand for governance over visibility. No tool offers multi-client cash supervision, leaving CAS 2.0 firms stuck with fragmented workflows.

**RowCol's Edge**: Unifies siloed rails into a multi-client Financial Control Plane using hub-and-spoke architecture, enabling scalable advisory with audit-proof outcomes.

### **What's New with CAS 2.0?**

Over the past 5+ years, new technology stacks and client demands have pushed accounting firms toward CAS 2.0, where standardized, automated workflows deliver strategic advisory alongside operations. Unlike traditional bookkeeping or CAS 1.0, CAS 2.0 firms bundle weekly cash governance with A/P, A/R, and KPIs to drive client value.

| Attribute | Bookkeeping (Traditional) | CAS 1.0 (2010s) | CAS 2.0 (Modern) |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Scope** | Data entry, reconciliations | Bookkeeping, bill pay, payroll | Bookkeeping, A/P, A/R, weekly advisory |
| **Tech Stack** | QBO, manual processes | QBO, Bill.com, Gusto | QBO, Ramp/Relay, Plaid, Stripe |
| **Workflow** | Client-specific, manual | Semi-standardized | Standardized, automated |
| **Touchpoints** | Month-end, year-end | Monthly reports | Weekly cash checks, monthly KPIs |
| **Value Proposition** | Compliance | Outsourced back office | Strategic advisory + operations |
| **Staff Roles** | Bookkeepers | Bookkeepers, clerks | Bookkeepers, controllers, advisors |

## **How RowCol Works: Multi-Rail Financial Control Plane**

RowCol's **verification loop** (Approve → Execute → Verify → Record) streamlines cash discipline across 20–100 clients using a hub-and-spoke architecture with Smart Sync patterns.

### **Core Architecture**

**Progressive Hub Model**: RowCol's hub centrality evolves as we add rails and prove the architecture:

#### **MVP Phase (QBO-Centric)**
- **QBO (Hub)**: Single source of truth for ledger data - where all truth ends up
- **RowCol (Orchestrator)**: Coordinates QBO operations and provides advisor interface
- **Future Rails**: Will be added as spokes to QBO hub

#### **Full Vision (RowCol as Operational Hub)**
- **RowCol (Operational Hub)**: Advisors' interface - orchestrates all financial operations
- **QBO (Ledger Hub)**: Source of record for GAAP-compliant data - the official ledger truth
- **Ramp (Execution Rail)**: Executes payments as directed by RowCol
- **Plaid (Verification Rail)**: Provides real-time verification data to RowCol
- **Stripe (Insights Rail)**: Provides A/R insights to RowCol

**Smart Sync Pattern**: Domain gateways orchestrate data flow through sync orchestrators that intelligently switch between local mirrors and live rail data, with complete transaction logging for audit trails.

**Key Insight**: In MVP, QBO is the hub because we're proving the Smart Sync pattern with a single rail. In the full vision, RowCol becomes the operational hub that orchestrates multiple rails while QBO remains the ledger hub for data lineage. This progression is what makes RowCol a Financial Control Plane rather than just another dashboard.

### **Product Components**

1. **Multi-Client Console**: Portfolio dashboard with red/yellow/green buffer status and client drill-downs
2. **Decision Console**: Bill approval interface with runway impact calculations and guardrail enforcement
3. **Client Digest System**: Branded weekly summaries for client delivery with audit trails
4. **Hygiene Tray**: Cross-rail data validation and discrepancy detection with one-click remediation

### **Verification Loop Flow**

**Approve → Execute → Verify → Record**:

1. **Approve (RowCol)**: Advisors approve bills with liquidity guardrails (e.g., 14-day buffer) based on Plaid cash balances
2. **Execute (Ramp)**: Ramp releases payments and syncs BillPayments to QBO
3. **Verify (RowCol)**: Confirm execution via Ramp webhooks and Plaid balance checks, flagging discrepancies
4. **Record (QBO)**: Store ledger data; RowCol logs audit notes for traceability

### **Cash Discipline Model**

- **Guardrails**: No approvals if buffer < 14 days or $10k; prioritize payroll/rent/taxes; pay on Tue/Thu
- **Cadence**: Weekly cash checks; monthly hygiene closes for data reliability
- **Horizons**: 7-14 day control horizon for liquidity; 30-60 day advisory horizon for trends
- **KPIs**:
  - **Runway Buffer Days**: Tracks 7-14 day cushion, saving 30+ min/client/week
  - **Approval Hit Rate**: Targets 50%+ bills via RowCol, streamlining approvals
  - **A/R Friction Index**: Informs runway via multi-rail data, supporting 70% pilot buy-in
  - **Drift Rate**: Detects variances, eliminating spreadsheets by week 3

## **Why Choose RowCol**

RowCol delivers multi-client cash discipline, unifying rails for scalable advisory, unlike single-client or compliance-focused tools.

**For Advisors**:
- **Scalability**: One console for 20–100 clients
- **Efficiency**: 5–10 minutes/client vs. 30–45 minutes
- **Stewardship**: Friday Cash Digests position you as a financial steward, strengthening $5k-$10k/month retainers
- **Trust**: Guardrails ensure safe approvals; audit trails prove compliance

**For Clients**:
- **Trust**: Digests show proactive governance
- **Clarity**: Simple, branded summaries
- **Reliability**: Essentials (payroll, rent) always clear

### **Advisor and Client Experience (Backstage → Front stage)**
RowCol supports advisors "backstage" to reduce surprises and speeds decisions, and presents clear stewardship "front stage" to clients.

- **Backstage (Advisor)**: Pre‑flight readiness (cross‑rail hygiene), variance watchlist, guardrail‑enforced decisions, and WWW (Who/What/When) capture; forecast freshness/confidence to extend decision distance
- **Front stage (Client)**: Weekly Digest or equivalent deliverable with a Pre‑flight badge, top variances, updated runway, and WWW next‑steps; short, branded, and audit‑linked
- **Modes**: Active (live cash call), Managed (as‑needed), Silent (auto digest) all use the same four surfaces (Digest, Hygiene, Console, Forecast) without new modules

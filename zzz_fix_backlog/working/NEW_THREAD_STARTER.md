## **üìã CRITICAL SUCCESS PATTERNS**

### **Data Orchestrator Pattern (MANDATORY)**
```python
# Code example showing the pattern
class TestDriveDataOrchestrator(BaseDataOrchestrator):
    def __init__(self, db: Session, business_id: str):
        super().__init__(db, business_id)
        self.runway_calc = RunwayCalculator(db, business_id)
        self.priority_calc = PriorityCalculator(db, business_id)
    
    def get_test_drive_data(self) -> Dict:
        """Get all data needed for test drive experience."""
        return {
            "runway_data": self.runway_calc.calculate_runway(),
            "priority_data": self.priority_calc.calculate_priorities(),
            "business_context": self._get_business_context()
        }
```

**Key Principles**:
1. **Inherit from BaseDataOrchestrator** - Follow established base class patterns
2. **Inject Calculator Services** - Use RunwayCalculator, PriorityCalculator, etc.
3. **Return Structured Data** - Consistent data structure for experience services
4. **Business ID Scoping** - All operations scoped to business_id for multi-tenancy

## **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS**

1. **DO NOT** execute tasks without validating assumptions against actual codebase
2. **DO NOT** do blind search-and-replace without understanding context
3. **DO NOT** skip comprehensive cleanup requirements

## **‚úÖ VERIFICATION COMMANDS**

After each task completion:

```bash
# Check for correct pattern usage
grep -r "TestDriveDataOrchestrator" runway/experiences/test_drive.py
grep -r "DigestDataOrchestrator" runway/experiences/digest.py
grep -r "QBOMapper" . --include="*.py"

# Check for no old patterns
grep -r "TotalAmt\|DueDate\|VendorRef" runway/
grep -r "return 85.0\|return 92.0" runway/

# Check server status
# Check uvicorn in Cursor terminal - should be running without errors
```

## **üìä SUCCESS METRICS**

- All services follow the established pattern
- No circular dependencies between services
- Server runs without errors
- All tests pass

**Ready for execution!** üöÄ

**Status**: [ ] Discovery | [ ] Analysis | [ ] Design | [ ] Executable Tasks | [ ] Complete

**Dependencies**
- **Depends on**: S01_ARCHITECTURE_DISCOVERY_AUDIT.md
- **Blocks**: Production deployment, security compliance

**Thread Assignment**
- **Assigned to**: [Thread name/date]
- **Started**: [Date]
- **Completed**: [Date]

## **Read These Files First**

### **Architecture Context:**
- `docs/architecture/ADR-003-multi-tenancy-strategy.md` - Multi-tenancy patterns
- `domains/core/services/base_service.py` - TenantAwareService implementation
- `infra/auth/auth.py` - Authentication and authorization

## **Problem Statement**

**Critical Issue**: Multi-tenancy implementation may have security gaps that could allow data leakage between businesses.

**Specific Problems**:
1. **Data isolation** may not be properly enforced
2. **Authentication context** may not be consistently applied
3. **business_id filtering** may be missing in some services
4. **Hardcoded values** may bypass tenant isolation

**Business Impact**: 
- Security vulnerability: Risk of data leakage between businesses
- Compliance risk: SOC 2 and data privacy violations
- Legal liability: Customer data exposure

## **Discovery Phase**

### **1. Multi-Tenancy Implementation Audit**

**Discovery Commands**:
```bash
# Check for business_id filtering in all services
grep -r "business_id" domains/*/services/ | head -20
grep -r "business_id" runway/*/services/ | head -20

# Check for hardcoded values that bypass tenant isolation
grep -r "api_user\|hardcoded" . --include="*.py" | head -10

# Check authentication context usage
grep -r "get_current_user\|auth" . --include="*.py" | head -10

# Check for direct database queries without business_id
grep -r "db\.query" . --include="*.py" | grep -v "business_id" | head -10
```

**Expected Outputs**:
- [ ] List of services missing business_id filtering
- [ ] Identification of hardcoded values
- [ ] Analysis of authentication context usage
- [ ] List of unsafe database queries

## **Analysis Phase**

### **1. Security Risk Assessment**

**Questions to Answer**:
- Which services could leak data between tenants?
- Where are the authentication bypasses?
- What's the impact of each security gap?

**Risk Categories**:
- **P0 Critical**: Direct data leakage between businesses
- **P1 High**: Authentication bypasses
- **P2 Medium**: Missing tenant filtering
- **P3 Low**: Inconsistent patterns

## **Design Phase**

### **1. Multi-Tenancy Security Hardening**

**Required Changes**:
- All services must filter by business_id
- Authentication context must be enforced
- Hardcoded values must be removed
- Database queries must be tenant-aware

### **2. Security Testing Strategy**

**Test Cases**:
- Attempt to access other business data
- Test authentication bypasses
- Verify tenant isolation
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## **Success Criteria**

- [ ] All services properly filter by business_id
- [ ] No hardcoded values that bypass tenant isolation
- [ ] Authentication context enforced everywhere
- [ ] Security tests pass
- [ ] Multi-tenancy compliance documented

## **Deliverables**

- [ ] Updated `docs/architecture/ADR-003-multi-tenancy-strategy.md`
- [ ] Security-hardened service implementations
- [ ] `MULTI_TENANCY_SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md`
- [ ] Security test suite
- [ ] Compliance documentation

## **Time Estimate**

- **Discovery**: 1 hour
- **Analysis**: 30 minutes
- **Design**: 1 hour
- **Total**: 2.5 hours

# NEXT_THREAD_GUIDANCE.md

**For the next thread starting fresh**

## **What This Thread Accomplished**

### **‚úÖ Complete Architecture Refactoring**
- **S01, S02, S07, S08, E02, E03**: All completed successfully
- **Architecture Status**: Fully aligned and ready for feature development
- **Multi-tenant Safety**: Properly implemented with business_id isolation

### **‚úÖ Key Architectural Pattern Established**
```
Data Orchestrators ‚Üí Calculators ‚Üí Experiences
```
- **Data Orchestrators**: State management + data pulling (5 services)
- **Calculators**: Pure business logic (5 consolidated calculators)  
- **Experiences**: User-facing services (4 services)

## **What's Ready for Next Thread**

### **‚úÖ Solid Foundation**
- All runway/ services follow proper architectural patterns
- Multi-tenant isolation properly implemented
- Clear separation of concerns established
- Consistent naming and patterns throughout

### **‚úÖ Ready for Feature Development**
- Smart AP/AR features can now be built on solid foundation
- No architectural blockers remaining
- Clear patterns to follow for new features

## **What the Next Thread Should Focus On**

### **üéØ Option A: Strategic Architecture Assessment (Recommended)**
- **S01_STRATEGIC_ARCHITECTURE_ASSESSMENT.md** - NEW, focused approach
- **Stay at ADR level** - Don't dive into implementation details
- **Assess existing ADRs** for drift and strategic alignment
- **Cast vision** for what architecture should be
- **Create focused solutioning tasks** (one ADR per task)

### **üéØ Option B: Feature Development**
- Build Smart AP/AR features using established patterns
- Follow the Data Orchestrators ‚Üí Calculators ‚Üí Experiences architecture
- Maintain multi-tenant safety (always scope by business_id)

### **üéØ Option C: Remaining Architecture Tasks (Not Recommended)**
- **S03 (Multi-Tenancy Security)**: May still be relevant for security hardening
- **S04 (Service Boundaries)**: May need clarification for new features
- **S05 (Circular Dependencies)**: May need to check for new dependencies
- **S06 (Security Hardening)**: May need security review

## **Key Insight: Why S01 Failed Before**

### **‚ùå What Went Wrong**
- **S01 was too broad** - tried to do everything at once
- **Got overwhelmed** - immediately backed off to focus on just ADR-006/S02
- **Lost strategic focus** - became tactical implementation instead of strategic assessment

### **‚úÖ What We Learned**
- **One well-executed ADR can reveal and solve multiple connected issues**
- **Stay at ADR level** - don't dive into implementation details
- **Focus on strategic alignment** - not comprehensive implementation
- **Create focused solutioning tasks** - one ADR per task

### **‚úÖ New S01 Approach**
- **Strategic focus** - assess ADRs for drift and alignment
- **Vision casting** - what should architecture be at strategic level
- **Focused scope** - one ADR per solutioning task
- **Clear boundaries** - stay at ADR level, don't get overwhelmed

## **Key Files for Next Thread**

- `runway/routes/` - All routes updated to use new architecture
- `runway/services/README.md` - Architecture documentation

### **üìÅ Archived (Don't Reassess)**
- `archive/S02_STATE_MANAGEMENT_STRATEGY.md` - COMPLETE
- `archive/S07_ORCHESTRATOR_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` - COMPLETE  
- `archive/S08_EXPERIENCE_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` - COMPLETE
- `archive/E02_FIX_DATA_ORCHESTRATOR_PATTERN.md` - COMPLETE

## **Architecture Patterns to Follow**

### **‚úÖ Data Orchestrators**
- Manage state in database with business_id scoping
- Pull data from domains using SmartSyncService
- Transform data for frontend consumption

### **‚úÖ Calculators**
- Pure business logic functions
- Stateless services that receive data as parameters
- Can be shared across experiences

### **‚úÖ Experience Services**
- User-facing business logic
- Orchestrate between calculators and data orchestrators
- Handle API response formatting

## **Next Thread Success Criteria**

1. **Build features using established patterns** ‚úÖ
2. **Maintain multi-tenant safety** ‚úÖ
3. **Follow architectural guidelines** ‚úÖ
4. **Don't reassess completed architecture work** ‚úÖ

**The architecture is now solid and ready for feature development! Focus on building Smart AP/AR features using the established patterns.** üöÄ

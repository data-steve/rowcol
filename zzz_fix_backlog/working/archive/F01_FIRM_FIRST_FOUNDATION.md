# F01: Firm-First Multi-Tenant Foundation

**Status**: üî¥ READY TO START  
**Effort**: 180 hours (6-8 weeks)  
**Priority**: P0 CRITICAL  
**Phase**: 3-6 (Foundation ‚Üí CAS Firm Pilots)

---

## Context

**STRATEGIC PIVOT (2025-09-30)**: CAS firms as primary ICP, not individual owners.

**Why**:  
- Levi Morehouse (Aiwyn.ai President) validated: "10,000% right - real need"
- But: Owners won't maintain data completeness
- Solution: CAS firms can ensure data quality, enforce ritual
- Pricing: $50/mo per client scales better than $99/mo per owner

**What Changed**:
- ‚ùå Agentic positioning (P0 ‚Üí P2)
- ‚ùå Smart Policies/Budgets (P0 ‚Üí P2)
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant foundation (NEW P0)
- ‚úÖ Data completeness (NEW P0)

## What's NOT Included (Deprioritized to Phase 7+)

‚ùå Agentic positioning / "AI learns preferences" messaging  
‚ùå Smart Policies/Budgets  
‚ùå Advanced analytics with ML  
‚ùå Direct owner access (business.firm_id = NULL)  
‚ùå QBO App Store distribution  

**Why**: CAS firms care about reliability and data completeness, not AI buzzwords. Focus on making the ritual work at scale first.

## Dependencies

**Wait For**:
- [ ] Levi's COO design session (tactical workflow guidance)

**External**:
- [ ] Plaid account approval and API access
- [ ] Research POS integration options

**Internal**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 0-2 complete (foundation ready)
- ‚úÖ Architecture multi-tenant ready (`business_id` scoping)

## Timeline

| Week | Phase | Effort | Status |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1-2 | Phase 3: Multi-tenant foundation | 40h | üî¥ Next |
| 3-4 | Phase 4: Data completeness | 60h | üìã Planned |
| 5-6 | Phase 5: Multi-client dashboard | 50h | üìã Planned |
| 7-8 | Phase 6: CAS firm pilots | 30h | üìã Planned |

**Total: 180 hours (6-8 weeks solo)**

## Notes

- Architecture already supports this (business_id scoping)
- Not starting over - adding firm layer to what we have
- Product is the same (weekly cash call ritual)
- Just different user context (firm managing clients vs owner managing business)

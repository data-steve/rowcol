# Blocked Tasks - SmartSync & QBO Architecture Cleanup

*Generated from infrastructure consolidation cleanup on 2025-01-27*  
*Status: ⏸️ BLOCKED BY SOLUTION TASKS*

## **Task Complexity Curation**

**⏸️ BLOCKED TASKS (0 tasks)** - These tasks are:
- Ready for hands-free execution (same complexity as executable tasks)
- Blocked by solution tasks that need to be completed first
- Will become executable once dependencies are resolved

**Note:** After reviewing all tasks from the original backlogs, all tasks that are ready for execution have been moved to the executable tasks list. The remaining tasks that need solution work are in the "Needs Solving" list. There are no tasks that are blocked by solution tasks - all blocked tasks have been resolved by moving them to the appropriate lists.

---

## **Context for Blocked Tasks**

Blocked tasks are tasks that:
- Have all the detail needed for hands-free execution
- Are blocked by solution tasks that need to be completed first
- Will become executable once their dependencies are resolved
- Should be moved to executable tasks once unblocked

---

## **Blocking Analysis**

### **Current Status:**
- **Executable Tasks:** 8 tasks ready for hands-free execution
- **Needs Solving Tasks:** 5 tasks requiring analysis and solution work
- **Blocked Tasks:** 0 tasks (all blocking dependencies have been resolved)

### **Dependency Map:**
- **Task 1-8 (Executable):** No blocking dependencies - ready to execute
- **Task 9-13 (Needs Solving):** Require analysis work - not blocked by other tasks

### **Resolution Path:**
1. **Execute Tasks 1-8** - Get foundation working
2. **Solve Tasks 9-13** - Complete analysis and solution work
3. **No additional blocked tasks** - All blocking dependencies resolved

---

## **Summary**

- **Total Blocked Tasks:** 0
- **Status:** ✅ **NO BLOCKED TASKS**

**Key Points:**
- All tasks that were ready for execution have been moved to executable tasks
- All tasks that need solution work have been moved to needs solving tasks
- No tasks are currently blocked by other tasks
- The original blocking dependencies have been resolved through proper task curation

**Next Steps:**
1. Execute the 8 executable tasks to get foundation working
2. Work through the 5 solution tasks when you have bandwidth
3. No blocked tasks to worry about - all dependencies resolved

This backlog contains **no blocked tasks** - all blocking dependencies have been resolved through proper task curation.

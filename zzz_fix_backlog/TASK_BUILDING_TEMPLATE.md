# Task Building Template

*Template for curating tasks by complexity into Executable, Needs Solving, and Blocked categories*

## **Required Context Documentation**

Every task document MUST include a "Read These Files First" section with these specific files:

### **Architecture Context (Required for All Tasks):**
- `docs/architecture/COMPREHENSIVE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system architecture
- `docs/build_plan_v5.md` - Current build plan and phase context
- `docs/architecture/ADR-001-domains-runway-separation.md` - Domain separation principles
- `docs/architecture/ADR-005-qbo-api-strategy.md` - QBO integration strategy
- `docs/architecture/ADR-003-multi-tenancy-strategy.md` - Multi-tenancy patterns
- `DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` - Development standards and anti-patterns

## **Task Categories**

### **CRITICAL: Task Naming Convention**

**Executable Tasks**: `E01_[MEANINGFUL_NAME].md`
- **E** = Executable (ready for hands-free execution)
- **01** = Sequence number (E01, E02, E03...)
- **MEANINGFUL_NAME** = Key identifier (visible in Cursor @ attachment)

**Solutioning Tasks**: `S01_[MEANINGFUL_NAME].md`
- **S** = Solutioning (needs analysis and design)
- **01** = Sequence number (S01, S02, S03...)
- **MEANINGFUL_NAME** = Key identifier (visible in Cursor @ attachment)

**Examples**:
- `E01_TESTDRIVE_ORCHESTRATOR.md` - "Create TestDriveDataOrchestrator following established pattern"
- `E02_QBOMAPPER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - "Implement QBOMapper for bill data mapping"
- `S01_CONSOLE_PAYMENT_WORKFLOW.md` - "Design Console Payment Decision Workflow"
- `S02_BULK_DIGEST_PROCESSING.md` - "Architect bulk digest processing for 1000+ businesses"

**Benefits**:
- **Prefix visible** in Cursor's @ attachment (E01_, S01_)
- **Key identifier visible** immediately after prefix
- **Sequence number** for ordering
- **Short enough** to be readable in file explorers

### **CRITICAL: Task Granularity Guidelines**

**Executable Tasks (E01_, E02_, E03_...)**:
- **Size**: 2-4 hours of focused work
- **Scope**: One service, one pattern, one feature
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external context needed
- **Thread Assignment**: 3-5 executable tasks per thread

**Solutioning Tasks (S01_, S02_, S03_...)**:
- **Size**: One major architectural problem
- **Scope**: One complex system or integration
- **Dependencies**: Extensive discovery and analysis needed
- **Thread Assignment**: One solutioning task per thread

**Granularity Decision Tree**:
When curating tasks, ask:
1. **Can this be completed in 2-4 hours?** ‚Üí Executable Task (E prefix)
2. **Does this need extensive discovery?** ‚Üí Solutioning Task (S prefix)
3. **Is this too big for one thread?** ‚Üí Break into smaller tasks
4. **Is this too small to be meaningful?** ‚Üí Combine with related tasks

### **CRITICAL: Solutioning Task Lifecycle Management**

**Solutioning Task Status Tracking**:
```markdown
## **Status**: [ ] Discovery | [ ] Analysis | [ ] Design | [ ] Executable Tasks | [ ] Complete

## **Dependencies**
- **Depends on**: [List of prerequisite solutioning tasks]
- **Blocks**: [List of tasks this blocks]

## **Thread Assignment**
- **Assigned to**: [Thread name/date]
- **Started**: [Date]
- **Completed**: [Date]
```

**Solutioning Coordination**:
- **One solutioning task per thread** (keep focused)
- **Update status** when starting/completing tasks
- **Convert to executable tasks** when design is complete
- **Archive completed tasks** to `archive/` folder

**File Organization**:
```
zzz_fix_backlogs/working/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ E01_TESTDRIVE_ORCHESTRATOR.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ E02_QBOMAPPER_IMPLEMENTATION.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ S01_CONSOLE_PAYMENT_WORKFLOW.md

- Resolution Path
- Summary

## **Curation Process**

### **Step 1: Read and Understand**
1. Read the original backlog completely
2. Understand the context and goals
3. Identify all tasks and their current state

### **Step 2: Add Required Context Documentation**
1. Add "Read These Files First" section to each task document
2. Include the 5 required architecture context files
3. Add task-specific context files as needed
4. Ensure all context files are accessible and relevant

### **Step 3: Categorize by Complexity**
For each task, ask:

#### **Executable Task Gatekeeping Questions:**
- **Is this fully solved?** (Clear implementation pattern exists)
- **Are ALL files identified?** (Not just initial files, but comprehensive discovery commands provided)
- **Is the recursive triage process defined?** (Understand context before changing)
- **Are cleanup requirements comprehensive?** (Handle all edge cases, not just basic changes)
- **Is there NO "figure out" language?** (Everything is specific and actionable)
- **Can any developer execute this?** (No additional context needed)

**If ANY answer is NO ‚Üí Needs Solving**

#### **Needs Solving Task Gatekeeping Questions:**
- **Does this need analysis work?** (Discovery, understanding, design required)
- **Is there "figure out" or "determine" language?** (Indicates unknowns)
- **Are there architectural decisions needed?** (Requires human input)
- **Are dependencies unclear?** (Need to map relationships)
- **Does the solution need to be designed?** (Not just implemented)

**If ANY answer is YES ‚Üí Needs Solving**

#### **Blocked Task Gatekeeping Questions:**
- **Is this ready for execution?** (Same complexity as executable tasks)
- **Is it blocked by solution tasks?** (Dependencies need to be resolved first)
- **Will it become executable once unblocked?** (No additional analysis needed)

**If ALL answers are YES ‚Üí Blocked**

#### **Document Creation Gatekeeping Questions:**
When you discover a new issue during task curation, ask:

**For Solutioning Tasks:**
- **Is this a major architectural problem?** (Requires extensive discovery/analysis)
- **Does this intersect with multiple systems?** (Complex untangling needed)
- **Is this a standalone problem?** (Can be contained in one solutioning doc)
- **Does this need its own solutioning thread?** (Too complex to add to existing task)

**If YES to any ‚Üí Create new solutioning task**

**For Executable Tasks:**
- **Is this a simple implementation issue?** (Can be added to existing task)
- **Is this a discovery finding?** (Add to task document, don't create new doc)
- **Is this a verification step?** (Add to task document)

**If YES to any ‚Üí Add to existing executable task, NO new docs**

### **CRITICAL: Architectural Decision Promotion**

**When to Promote Working Docs to ADRs:**
- **Architectural decisions are stable** - no more changes expected
- **Patterns are proven** - have been implemented and tested
- **Hard won wisdom** - decisions that required significant iteration
- **Reusable patterns** - other developers need to follow these patterns
- **Verification commands exist** - can be automatically checked

**ADR Promotion Process:**
1. **Working doc contains stable architectural decision**
2. **Create ADR-XXX in `docs/architecture/`**
3. **Use ADR template** - status, decision, implementation, examples, verification
4. **Archive working doc** - move to `archive/` folder
5. **Update references** - point to new ADR location

**ADR Template:**
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status**: Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated
- **Context**: [What problem this solves]

## Decision
[What was decided]

## Implementation
[How to implement this pattern]

## Examples
[Code examples showing the pattern]

## Verification
[How to verify this pattern is being followed]

## Related ADRs
- ADR-XXX: [Related decision]
```

### **CRITICAL: Assumption Validation Before Task Curation**

**NEVER curate tasks without validating assumptions against reality.**

#### **Required Validation Steps:**
1. **Run Discovery Commands** - Find all occurrences of patterns mentioned in tasks
2. **Read Actual Code** - Don't assume task descriptions are accurate
3. **Compare Assumptions vs Reality** - Document mismatches
4. **Identify Architecture Gaps** - Understand current vs intended state
5. **Question Task Scope** - Are tasks solving the right problems?

#### **Discovery Documentation Template:**
```
### What Actually Exists:
- [List what you found that exists]

### What the Task Assumed:
- [List what the task assumed exists]

### Assumptions That Were Wrong:
- [List assumptions that don't match reality]

### Architecture Mismatches:
- [List where current implementation differs from intended architecture]

### Task Scope Issues:
- [List where tasks may be solving wrong problems or have unclear scope]
```

### **CRITICAL: Recursive Discovery/Triage Pattern**

**NEVER do blind search-and-replace!** This pattern prevents costly mistakes during task curation:

1. **Search for all occurrences** of patterns mentioned in the task
2. **Read the broader context** around each occurrence to understand what the method, service, route, or file is doing
3. **Triage each occurrence** - determine what it actually does vs what the task assumes:
   - What is this method's real purpose?
   - What are its dependencies and relationships?
   - What would break if we changed it?
   - Is this a false positive or actually relevant?
4. **Map the real system** - understand how things actually work vs how the task assumes they work
5. **Document assumptions vs reality** - write down what you found vs what the task assumed
6. **Plan based on reality** - design solutions based on what actually exists

**Example Discovery Pattern:**
```bash
# Step 1: Find all occurrences
grep -r "get_.*_for_digest" . --include="*.py"

# Step 2: For each file found, read the broader context
# - What is this method actually doing?
# - What are its real dependencies?
# - How is it being used in practice?
# - What would break if we changed it?

# Step 3: Map the real system
# - How do these pieces actually connect?
# - What are the real data flows?
# - What are the real dependencies?

# Step 4: Document reality vs assumptions
# - What did the task assume vs what actually exists?
# - What patterns are we seeing?
# - What needs to be designed vs what can be fixed?
```

### **Step 4: Preserve All Detail**
- **Lift and shift** - don't edit or simplify
- Preserve all critical warnings, search commands, verification steps
- Keep all implementation patterns and code examples
- Maintain all context and justification

### **Step 5: Create Curated Files**
1. Create `0_EXECUTABLE_TASKS.md` with fully-solved tasks
2. Create `1_NEEDS_SOLVING_TASKS.md` with analysis tasks
3. Create `2_BLOCKED_TASKS.md` with blocked tasks
4. Archive original files

### **Step 6: Clean Up**
- Remove "spec" and "agent" references
- Remove "Ready for Spec" status
- Update "Next Action" to point to next task
- Ensure consistent formatting

- **Don't simplify** - preserve all detail from original
- **Don't edit tasks** - just curate by complexity
- **Don't remove warnings** - they're there for a reason
- **Don't change verification steps** - they're tested and working
- **Don't add new requirements** - just organize existing ones
- **Don't forget git workflow** - surgical commits are essential

## **Critical Lessons Learned**

### **Why Tasks Fail:**
1. **Assumption-Based Planning**: Tasks planned based on assumptions, not reality
2. **Incomplete Discovery**: Tasks list specific files but miss others found during execution
3. **Blind Search-and-Replace**: Changes made without understanding context
4. **Insufficient Cleanup**: Edge cases and dependencies not handled
5. **Missing File Operations**: Using `mv` instead of `cp` then `rm`
6. **No Todo Integration**: Progress not tracked in Cursor todo list
7. **Needless Questions**: Asking questions that can be answered through discovery or analysis

### **Success Patterns:**
1. **Assumption Validation**: Always validate task assumptions against actual codebase
2. **Comprehensive Discovery**: Find ALL occurrences, not just initial files
3. **Recursive Triage**: Understand context before making changes
4. **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Handle all edge cases and dependencies
5. **Proper File Operations**: Use `cp` then `rm` for moves
6. **Todo Integration**: Track progress and discovered edge cases
7. **Self-Sufficient Analysis**: Answer questions through discovery before asking for help

### **Template Requirements:**
- **Every task MUST have assumption validation completed before curation**
- **Every executable task MUST have comprehensive discovery commands**
- **Every executable task MUST have recursive triage process**
- **Every executable task MUST have comprehensive cleanup requirements**
- **Every executable task MUST have todo list integration**
- **Gatekeeping questions MUST be used to distinguish task types**

## **Working Relationship Guidelines**

### **Principal Architecture Role**
- **Technical Co-founder Support**: Provide principal architecture conviction, direction, and support
- **Solutioning Phase**: Drive technical architecture decisions and design solutions
- **Execution Phase**: Hand off "solutioned" problems to junior dev level implementation
- **Code Quality**: Ensure solutions are maintainable by junior-mid level engineers with AI support

### **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
1. **Needless Questions**: Don't ask questions that can be answered through:
   - Discovery commands and analysis
   - Reading existing documentation
   - Examining the codebase
   - Previous conversation context
2. **Repeating Information**: Don't ask for information already provided in:
   - Attached files
   - Previous messages
   - Context already established
3. **Assumption-Based Questions**: Validate assumptions through discovery before asking questions

### **Effective Question Patterns**
- **Architecture Decisions**: "Do you agree with this approach, or do you see a better way?"
- **Priority Clarification**: "Should we fix the immediate runtime errors first, or design the full architecture?"
- **Scope Boundaries**: "Should we handle mock removal as part of this solution, or separately?"
- **Technical Conviction**: "What's your conviction on these architectural choices?"

### **Code Quality Standards**
- **Junior Developer Test**: Every piece of code should be understandable by a junior/mid-level developer within 30 seconds
- **AI Coder Support**: Code should be maintainable with AI assistance
- **Documentation**: In-line comments, preambles, docstrings, clear naming, clear patterns
- **Future Maintenance**: Code should be understandable weeks/months later by you, colleagues, or GPT-coders

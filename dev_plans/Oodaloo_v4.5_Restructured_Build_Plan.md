# Oodaloo v4.5 Restructured Build Plan: Logical MVP Flow

**Version**: 4.5  
**Date**: 2025-09-18  
**Restructured From**: v4.4 Master Build Plan  
**Key Changes**: 
- Removed unrealistic features requiring external data we don't have
- Reordered phases: Analytics â†’ Budget Planning â†’ Smart Automation
- Split major components into dedicated phases for better focus

## Oodaloo â†’ RowCol Transition Architecture

**Key Principle**: `business` in Oodaloo = `client` in RowCol

**Oodaloo (Owner-Centric)**:
- Single business owner managing their QBO
- `business_id` as primary tenant identifier  
- Analytics about the business performance
- Simple user model (owner + bookkeeper)

**RowCol Transition Point**: When we add multi-client management capabilities
- Introduce `firm_id` as higher-level tenant
- `business` becomes `client` in firm context
- Add staff roles, engagement workflows, task management
- Analytics remain client-focused (not firm operational metrics)

**Preserved Concepts**:
- All business/client analytics and KPIs (same data, different context)
- Core AP/AR/Bank domain models (reusable across both products)
- QBO integration patterns (scale from 1:1 to 1:many)

**New RowCol Concepts**:
- `firm` â†’ `client` relationship management
- Staff permissions and role-based access
- Engagement and task workflow management
- Firm-level operational dashboards (separate from client analytics)

### Long-term Considerations
- **QBO App Store Submission**: Requirements and review process timeline
- **CAS Firm Partnerships**: Identify target accounting firms for RowCol phase
- **Compliance Requirements**: SOC 2, data privacy, financial data handling

This plan provides the architectural rigor and detailed task breakdown needed for successful execution while maintaining clear separation between domains/ (QBO primitives) and runway/ (product orchestration).


## Overview
- **Goal**: Build a sellable runway MVP in 6-8 weeks (~300-350h solo) for service agencies ($1Mâ€“$5M, 10-30 staff), targeting QBO marketplace and CAS firm channels. Automate 70-80% of weekly cash runway decisions with QBO integration.
- **Scope**: **Cash runway management only** - not accrual accounting, revenue recognition, or month-end close workflows. Focus: "How much cash do I have today?" not "What's my GAAP-compliant revenue?"
- **Target Market**: Service agencies using **cash accounting** who need weekly runway decisions, not CAS firms doing complex bookkeeping.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (SQLite dev, Postgres prod), QBO API, SendGrid, Pydantic, Pytest, Redis (caching), Chart.js (analytics).
- **Definition of 'Smart' for Oodaloo**: Our features are designed to be 'smart' by reducing cognitive load and providing actionable insights at the moment of decision, not through complex AI or over-predictive models. We define 'smart' across three tiers:
  - **Connective Intelligence**: Linking AP, AR, and cash runway in real-time to show cross-domain decision impacts, unlike QBO's siloed approach.
  - **Workflow Intelligence**: Transforming a passive ledger into an active decision-making ritual with guided, prioritized actions (e.g., Prep Tray workflows).
  - **Light-Touch Predictive Intelligence**: Offering simple, actionable heuristics (e.g., 'This customer pays in 47 days on average') instead of complex forecasts that create noise.
- **Architectural Foundation (Already Established)**:
  - âœ… **SmartSyncService**: Unified integration coordinator implemented in `domains/integrations/smart_sync.py` (moved from core)
  - âœ… **Centralized QBO Auth**: Token management centralized in `domains/integrations/qbo/qbo_auth.py` (eliminates service duplication)
  - âœ… **Identity Graph**: Cross-platform deduplication in `domains/integrations/identity_graph/` (prevents double-counting)
  - âœ… **TenantAwareService**: Business-centric isolation pattern implemented in `domains/core/services/base_service.py`  
  - âœ… **Models = Data Only Policy**: Business logic in services, not models (enforced system-wide)
  - âœ… **Clean Import Pattern**: Cascading imports via `__init__.py` files (main.py â†’ runway â†’ domains)

## Architecture Overview

### Domains/ Structure (QBO-Facing Primitives)
```
domains/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Business, User, Document models/services (simplified)
â”‚                   # Key services: KPIService, DocumentReviewService, DocumentStorageService
â”œâ”€â”€ integrations/   # External API coordination (NEW CENTRALIZED LAYER)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ smart_sync.py        # Unified integration coordinator (moved from core)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ identity_graph/      # Cross-platform deduplication (moved from root)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ qbo/                # QBO integration with centralized auth

â”œâ”€â”€ ap/             # Bill, Vendor, Payment models/services  
â”œâ”€â”€ ar/             # Invoice, Customer, Payment models/services
â”œâ”€â”€ bank/           # BankTransaction, Transfer models/services
â”œâ”€â”€ policy/         # Rule, Correction, Suggestion models/services
â””â”€â”€ vendor_normalization/  # VendorCanonical models/services (cross-cutting)
```

**Synthesized Audit Findings & Recent Refactoring**:
- **SmartSyncService**: Moved to `domains/integrations/smart_sync.py` for better architectural clarity.
- **Identity Graph**: Moved to `domains/integrations/identity_graph/` as it's pure integration deduplication logic.
- **Centralized QBO Auth**: `QBOAuth` now handles all token refresh logic, eliminating duplication across services.AR
- **Clean Integration Layer**: All external API coordination now centralized in `domains/integrations/`.

- **[âœ…] AP API Endpoints**: `/runway/ap/` endpoints for bills, payments, and vendors are complete.
- **[âœ…] Enhanced Tray Integration**: 'Must Pay' vs. 'Can Delay' categorization and runway impact visualization are complete.
- **[ ] Smart AP UI/UX Design & Implementation** *Effort: 15h* - **CRITICAL FOR ICP ADOPTION**
  - **Context**: For design-savvy ICP (ad agencies, marketing firms), the UI must feel genuinely "smart" and brand-forward, not like a basic accounting tool.
  - **[ ] Payment Timing Intelligence Interface** *Effort: 15h*
    - Design visual timeline showing "Pay Now" vs "Latest Safe Pay Date" with runway impact
    - Create intuitive slider/calendar component for payment scheduling with real-time runway calculations

  - **[ ] Overpayment Detection**: Automatically suggest credit memos for overpayments *Effort: 2h*
  - **[ ] Collections Integration**: Stop reminders when partial payment + credit memo created *Effort: 2h*
- **[ ] Collections Automation**:
  - **Context**: The `PARKED_FUNCTIONALITY_AUDIT` revealed that collection routes exist in `_parked/domains/ar/routes/collections.py` but the `CollectionsService` was not fully implemented. The parked routes also use the old `firm_id` which needs to be updated to `business_id`.
  - **[ ] 3-stage email sequences (30d gentle, 45d urgent, 60d final)**. *Effort: 10h*.
    - **Synthesized Plan**:
      - Implement the 3-stage email logic within the existing `domains/ar/services/collections.py`.
      - Create email templates in a new `runway/digest/templates/collections/` directory.
      - Use the existing `EmailService` pattern from the digest feature for delivery.
      - Mocking strategy should log emails to the console and a `logs/mock_collections.json` file for testing.
  - **[ ] Priority scoring: amount, age, customer history**. *Effort: 8h*.
    - **Synthesized Plan**:
      - Enhance the priority scoring algorithm in the `CollectionsService`.
      - Leverage the `CustomerService.get_payment_reliability()` method which is already implemented and provides customer risk scores.
      - The algorithm should combine invoice age, amount (e.g., >$5k boost), and the customer's payment reliability score.
      - Integrate 'Customer Payment Profiles' with simple heuristics (e.g., avg_days_to_pay, preferred contact method if available) to personalize scoring.
  - **[ ] Auto-pause on payment detection**. *Effort: 7h*.
    - **Synthesized Plan**:
      - Implement logic to automatically pause collection sequences.
      - This should hook into the `PaymentMatchingService`, which already detects and applies payments.
      - Add a status field to a `CollectionSequence` model to track its state (e.g., active, paused, completed).
      - Use the `SmartSyncService` to poll for new payments from QBO before sending a scheduled reminder.

### Stage 2.3: AR API & Integration (30h)
- **[âœ…] AR API Endpoints**: `/runway/ar/invoices/` and basic `/runway/ar/collections/` are complete.
- **[ ] `/runway/ar/collections/` - Manage reminder sequences**. *Effort: 5h*.
    - **Synthesized Plan**:
      - Un-park and refactor the routes from `_parked/domains/ar/routes/collections.py`.
      - Update routes to use `business_id` and the current `TenantAwareService` and auth middleware patterns.
      - Create API endpoints to allow users to start, stop, and view the status of collection sequences for a customer or invoice.
      - Implement 'Collection Playbook' UI in Prep Tray: Display prioritized actions (e.g., 'Chase Customer A with Urgent template now') based on payment profiles and runway impact.
- **[ ] `/runway/ar/payments/` - Payment matching and reconciliation**. *Effort: 5h*.
    - **Synthesized Plan**:
      - Create a new endpoint `POST /runway/ar/payments/match` for manual payment matching.
      - This endpoint will orchestrate the `PaymentMatchingService.match_payment_to_invoices()` method.
      - It should return match confidence scores to the UI and connect to the auto-pause collection logic.
- **[ ] Smart AR UI/UX Design & Implementation** *Effort: 28h* - **CRITICAL FOR ICP ADOPTION**
  - **Context**: Collections interfaces are typically ugly and intimidating. For creative agencies, this needs to feel strategic and professional, not aggressive.
  - **[ ] Credit Memo Intelligence Interface** *Effort: 8h* - **NEW SMART AR FEATURE**
    - Design smart credit memo creation flow with runway impact visualization
    - Create overpayment detection alerts: "Customer overpaid by $200 - create credit memo?"
    - Implement approval workflow for high-value credits with clear reasoning
    - Show runway protection: "This credit memo protects 3 days of runway"
  - **[ ] Collection Playbook Interface** *Effort: 15h*

  - **[ ] Payment Matching Intelligence** *Effort: 12h*
    - Design confidence-scored matching interface with visual similarity indicators
    - Create drag-and-drop payment allocation with real-time invoice updates
    - Implement smart suggestions: "This $5,000 payment likely matches Invoice #1234 (95% confidence)"
  - **[ ] AR Aging Visualization** *Effort: 8h*
    - Design elegant aging buckets that feel like a dashboard, not a report
    - Create runway impact indicators: "Collecting these 3 invoices funds next month's payroll"
    - Implement priority heat maps showing which collections have highest runway impact

## Phase 7+: RowCol Roadmap & Parked Functionality

*Goal*: Transform Oodaloo into a multi-tenant RowCol platform for CAS firms. This functionality is **out of scope** for the Runway MVP.

### **Phase 8: RowCol Compliance & Policy Engine**
- **Parked Functionality**: `_parked/domains/policy/` contains advanced rules for bookkeeping transaction compliance. This is a prerequisite for the "Close" product.

### **Phase 10: RowCol Close & Advanced Accounting**
- **Parked Functionality**:
  - **Revenue Recognition Engine**: 184-line GAAP-compliant implementation from `_parked/domains/ar/services/revenue_recognition.py`. This is for accrual accounting, not cash runway.
  - **PreClose System**: Complete month-end close workflows from `_parked/features/close/`.
  - **KPI Routes**: Existing routes in `_parked/domains/core/routes/kpi.py` that connect to active `KPIService` - unpark for Phase 3 Analytics.
  - **AR Collections Routes**: Partial implementation in `_parked/domains/ar/routes/collections.py` - integrate with Phase 2 Smart AR.
  
### **Phase 11: Multi-Tenant Architecture**
- **Parked Functionality**: Obsolete `Firm/Staff/Client/Engagement` models from `_parked/deprecated/`. These concepts will be re-introduced for RowCol's multi-tenant architecture.

### **Phase 12: Advanced CAS Features**
- **Parked Functionality**: `_parked/domains/ap/services/shared_expense_allocation.py` contains complex job costing logic for specialized contractors.
r each - **Task Management System**: The `Task` model and related services from `_parked/domains/core/models/task.py` are designed for the multi-tenant RowCol platform to manage staff assignments for client engagements. This will be re-introduced in the RowCol Close product.

## Parked Files Strategy

### High-Value References (Review & Extract Logic)
- **`_parked/domains/ap/services/statement_reconciliation.py`**: Payment matching algorithms
- **`_parked/domains/ar/services/collections.py`**: Collection sequence logic
- **`_parked/domains/policy/services/`**: Rule engine patterns
- **`_parked/domains/vendor_normalization/`**: Already successfully integrated

### Implementation Approach
1. **Review Phase** (5-10h per domain): Extract business logic, algorithms, data patterns
2. **Fresh Implementation** (20-30h per domain): Build using current Business model and db/ structure  
3. **Integration Testing** (10-15h per domain): Validate with Phase 0 testing foundation
4. **Total per domain**: 35-55h (vs. 60-80h debugging old relationships)

### Files to Skip Entirely
- **`_parked/core/models/`**: Obsolete Client/Firm architecture

## Critical Architectural Decisions Needed

### Audit Logging Strategy (Phase 3-4)
**Current State**: Partial audit_log.py and _decorators.py exist but need design decisions

**Key Questions**:
- **Entity Types**: Currently designed for Firm/User/Asset RBAC. Oodaloo needs Business/User/Transaction entities
- **Cause ID**: Correlation system for cascading service calls (e.g., "payment_batch_123" traces through multiple services)
- **RBAC Integration**: Do we need role-based permissions or simple business-owner-only access?
- **Audit Scope**: Financial transactions only vs. all business operations

**Proposed Approach**:
```yaml
Phase 3: Basic Financial Audit Logging
  - Transaction-level audit trails (payments, bills, adjustments)
  - Simple cause_id correlation for payment batches
  - Business-owner-only access (no RBAC complexity)
  
Phase 4+: Enhanced Audit System  
  - User role permissions (if multi-user needed)
  - Advanced correlation patterns
  - Compliance reporting features
```

**Effort**: 15-20h design + implementation

### API Versioning Strategy
**Current State**: Mixed `/api/v1/` and `/api/` prefixes

**Decision Needed**: Standardize on consistent versioning approach
- Option A: `/api/v1/` for all routes (future-proof)
- Option B: `/api/` for simplicity (current mixed state)

**Recommendation**: Standardize on `/api/v1/` (5h effort)
- **Most `_parked/tests/`**: Wrong fixtures and relationships  
- **`_parked/domains/webhooks/`**: Phase 4+ feature

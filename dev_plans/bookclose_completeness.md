given these requirements below for what BookClose has to do to support the following 2 roles below and the functionality listed in the 3rd slot , how close is @dev_plan.md 

```Here’s the set, written to match your “core perspective” — that **automation + detection** should handle 80%+ of the close, the **contract bookkeeper** enforces process and escalates, and the **controller/CPA** steps in only for true tier-2 issues.

---

## **1) Contract Close Bookkeeper (On-Call / Retainer)**

**Role Summary:**
We’re looking for a detail-oriented, process-driven bookkeeper to operate our monthly close automation system (BookClose) and ensure every close meets our D+5 target. You won’t be “closing the books” from scratch — our automation handles most categorization, reconciliations, and recurring entries. Your primary job is to monitor the Close Integrity Dashboard, resolve routine flagged items, and escalate anything requiring higher-level accounting judgment.

**Responsibilities:**

* Monitor BookClose compliance dashboard during close periods.
* Investigate and resolve low-level exceptions (e.g., missing docs, small recon mismatches, mislabeled attachments).
* Collect and upload supporting documentation for all reconciliations, JEs, and balance sheet accounts.
* Communicate with client staff to obtain missing statements or confirmations.
* Escalate tier-2 exceptions to the controller with complete evidence packages.
* Maintain close checklist discipline — ensure every required task is complete before D+5.

**Requirements:**

* 3–5 years bookkeeping experience, including reconciliations and month-end prep.
* Strong attention to detail and follow-through.
* Comfortable using cloud accounting tools (QBO, Xero) and portals.
* Process-oriented — follows checklists exactly, updates statuses promptly.
* Reliable availability during close windows (first 5–7 business days each month).

**Success Metric:**

* 95% of assigned exceptions resolved or escalated within 24 hours.
* Zero missed binder deadlines for D+5 clients.

## **2) Fractional Controller / CPA (On-Call)**

**Role Summary:**
We need a high-level accounting professional to act as the final authority on month-end closes, handling tier-2 exceptions that require technical accounting judgment. This is a part-time/fractional role, with equity potential for a founding team member. You’ll be called in when our BookClose system and close bookkeeper flag exceptions that automation cannot resolve — typically involving classification judgment, complex accruals, or multi-entity adjustments.

**Responsibilities:**

* Review escalated exceptions and determine proper accounting treatment.
* Approve or adjust journal entries related to tier-2 issues.
* Provide guidance on unusual transactions or compliance-sensitive balances.
* Validate the final trial balance, reconciliations, and binder before delivery.
* Advise on improvements to detection rules and escalation protocols in BookClose.

**Requirements:**

* Active CPA license or equivalent experience as a Controller/Director of Accounting.
* 7+ years experience in GAAP-compliant financial reporting and monthly close.
* Strong ability to quickly assess incomplete information and make accurate determinations.
* Availability to review and resolve escalations within 24 hours during close windows.
* Comfortable working in a lean, automation-heavy environment where your role is targeted to high-impact exceptions.

**Success Metric:**

* 100% of escalated cases resolved and validated in time for D+5 delivery.
* Zero post-delivery restatements or missed compliance items.

## **3) BookClose System – Detection & Escalation Layer**

**Role Summary:**
BookClose must act as the **first line of defense** for month-end close quality. Its job is to automatically detect anomalies, missing data, and compliance risks so that a diligent but non-senior operator can (a) resolve them directly if routine, or (b) escalate them to a controller with all supporting evidence attached.

**Detection Capabilities:**

* **Reconciliation Integrity:**

  * Bank, credit card, loan, AR, and AP balances must tie to the GL to the penny.
  * Flag any unreconciled transactions older than X days or above \$Y threshold.

* **Cutoff Tests:**

  * Flag transactions posted to the wrong period for cutoff-sensitive accounts.
  * Detect entries after month-end affecting the closed period.

* **Recurring JE Coverage:**

  * Verify expected recurring entries (prepaids, depreciation) exist and match schedules.
  * Flag missing, partial, or misdated JEs.

* **Variance & Reasonableness:**

  * Auto-flux analysis on key accounts; flag unexplained >X% changes.
  * Compare to historical norms and industry ranges where possible.

* **Supporting Documentation Completeness:**

  * Require a linked doc for every reconciliation, JE, and significant variance explanation.
  * Flag missing or mislabeled support.

* **Trial Balance Integrity:**

  * Enforce debits=credits; subledger tie-outs for AR, AP, inventory, and fixed assets.

**Escalation Enablement:**

* **Tier Classification:**

  * Tier 1 = routine, operator can fix (missing doc, minor recon item, mislabel).
  * Tier 2 = judgment required (classification, complex accrual, intercompany).
* **Evidence Packaging:**

  * Automatically bundle the flagged transaction(s), related account balances, source docs, and system notes into a controller-ready packet.
* **Controller Handoff:**

  * Notify controller, track resolution status, and log final decision for audit trail and future automation rules.

**Outcome:**
If BookClose flags it, the operator can **either resolve or escalate** — no guesswork. This ensures a conscientious local bookkeeper can run D+5 closes without being a seasoned controller, and the CPA/controller only sees the genuinely judgment-heavy cases.

If you want, I can now diagram **how these three roles interact across the first 5 days of a D+5 close** so you can show investors or cofounders how lean the staffing model is. That’d make the workflow visual and clearly defensible.

Do you want me to do that?

Looking at your requirements for the two roles and BookClose's detection/escalation capabilities, the `dev_plan.md` is **very close** to what you need, but there are some key gaps that need to be addressed to fully support this operational model.

Let me analyze the alignment:

## ✅ **What's Already Well-Covered:**

1. **Multi-tenant architecture** - All models include `firm_id` and proper tenant isolation
2. **Document management & OCR review** - Comprehensive document processing with review queues
3. **Task routing system** - `TaskService` with role-based assignments (`junior|senior|manager`)
4. **Review queue infrastructure** - `DocumentReviewService` with batching capabilities
5. **Policy engine** - `PolicyEngineService` for automated categorization and confidence scoring
6. **Basic exception handling** - `Exception` model and `PreCloseService`

## ❌ **Critical Gaps for Your Role Requirements:**

### **1. Tier Classification System**
The plan mentions "tier-2 exceptions" but doesn't implement the actual tiering logic:

```python
# Missing: Tier classification service
class TierClassificationService:
    def classify_exception(self, exception: Exception) -> Literal["tier1", "tier2"]
    def auto_resolve_tier1(self, exception: Exception) -> bool
    def escalate_tier2(self, exception: Exception) -> EscalationPackage
```

### **2. Evidence Packaging & Escalation**
While `Document` model exists, there's no service to automatically bundle evidence for controller handoff:

```python
# Missing: Evidence packaging service
class EvidencePackagingService:
    def create_escalation_package(self, exception: Exception) -> EscalationPackage
    def bundle_supporting_docs(self, je_id: str, recon_id: str) -> EvidenceBundle
    def track_escalation_status(self, escalation_id: str) -> EscalationStatus
```

### **3. Close Integrity Dashboard**
The plan has `preclose_dashboard.html` but lacks the specific detection capabilities you outlined:

```python
# Missing: Close integrity detection service
class CloseIntegrityService:
    def check_reconciliation_integrity(self, client_id: str, period: str) -> list[IntegrityIssue]
    def run_cutoff_tests(self, client_id: str, period: str) -> list[CutoffIssue]
    def verify_recurring_je_coverage(self, client_id: str, period: str) -> list[CoverageIssue]
    def analyze_variance_reasonableness(self, client_id: str, period: str) -> list[VarianceIssue]
```

### **4. Escalation Workflow**
No clear escalation path from BookClose → Bookkeeper → Controller:

```python
# Missing: Escalation workflow service
class EscalationWorkflowService:
    def route_to_bookkeeper(self, tier1_issue: Issue) -> Task
    def escalate_to_controller(self, tier2_issue: Issue) -> EscalationTask
    def track_resolution_status(self, issue_id: str) -> ResolutionStatus
```

## �� **What Needs to Be Added (Estimated: ~25-30 hours):**

### **New Models:**
- `EscalationPackage` - Controller-ready evidence bundles
- `IntegrityIssue` - Specific detection results (recon, cutoff, coverage, variance)
- `EscalationTask` - Controller assignments with evidence packages

### **New Services:**
- `TierClassificationService` - Auto-classify issues as tier 1 vs tier 2
- `CloseIntegrityService` - Run all detection tests you specified
- `EvidencePackagingService` - Bundle evidence for controller handoff
- `EscalationWorkflowService` - Route issues to appropriate role

### **Enhanced Templates:**
- `close_integrity_dashboard.html` - Show all detection results with tier classification
- `escalation_queue.html` - Controller view of tier 2 issues with evidence packages

## �� **Current Coverage: ~85%**

The foundation is excellent, but to fully support your operational model where:
- **BookClose** = Detection & tier classification
- **Bookkeeper** = Resolve tier 1, escalate tier 2
- **Controller** = Handle tier 2 with evidence packages

You need to add the **tier classification logic**, **evidence packaging**, and **close integrity detection** services. The existing architecture will support these additions cleanly.

Would you like me to outline the specific code changes needed to implement these missing pieces?

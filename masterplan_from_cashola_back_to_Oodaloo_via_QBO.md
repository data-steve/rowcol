Here’s a clean, **end-to-end strategy doc** that ties all the threads together into a phased plan.

# 🚀 Plan: From Jobber Wedge (Cashola) → General Controller Platform (Oodaloo/Escher)

---

## **Phase 1: Nail the Jobber Wedge (Cashola)**

**Objective:** Prove the “Weekly Cash Call” ritual in the simplest environment where AR + Cash can be automated without bookkeeping dependency.

* **ICP**: \$1–5M service trade firms (landscaping, HVAC, cleaners) on Jobber.
* **Data sources**:

  * AR → Jobber (invoices + payments).
  * Cash/credit → Plaid (bank + credit cards).
  * Payroll → cadence estimate.
* **Output**: Weekly one-page decision pack: “Cash today, AR due, payroll Friday, net runway.”
* **Distribution**: Jobber App Marketplace.
* **Pricing**: \$100–300/mo (owner-ops, SaaS-tier spend).
* **Brand**: **Cashola** (fits with marketplace + trades vibe).

⚡ *This is the MVP → prove owners care about the ritual, generate initial MRR, validate distribution.*

---

## **Phase 2: Scale or Spin Out Cashola**

* **Options**:

  * Keep running Cashola as a SaaS wedge in trades.
  * **Sell/partner**: let someone else take it deeper (into HCP/ServiceTitan, job costing, upsell into AR financing).
  * You retain rights/royalties, but free yourself to pursue the bigger play.

* **Extensions**:

  * Property management ERPs (Buildium, Entrata).
  * Vertical SaaS with AR modules (e.g. Mindbody for gyms).
  * Each vertical with recurring AR + Plaid integration = repeatable “Cashola” clones.

---

## **Phase 3: Build the Controller Layer (Oodaloo / Escher)**

**Objective:** Move upstream into **\$5–20M firms** where owners want not just visibility but execution + control.

* **ICP**: Light manufacturing, distribution, regional services, multi-entity firms.

* **Core product**:

  * **Weekly Cash Call app on QBO** (same ritual, but runs off AR/AP/Payroll from QBO + Plaid).
  * ML-driven exception handling (forecasting, anomaly detection, DSO risk).
  * Service-enabled layer: offshore bookkeepers keep QBO clean → app outputs stay accurate.
  * Controller-as-a-Service wrapper: variance reporting, AP scheduling, LOC alerts.

* **Distribution**: QuickBooks App Store (massive TAM, accountants channel).

* **Pricing ladder**:

  * **Self-serve app**: \$200–500/mo.
  * **App + bookkeeping service**: \$500–1.5k/mo.
  * **App + Controller layer**: \$2–3k/mo.

* **Brand**: **Oodaloo / Escher** — positioned as “controller layer for SMBs” (not just trades).

* **Secret sauce**: ML + offshore → scale with SaaS-like margins, exception-driven workflows.

---

## **Phase 4: Generalize the Playbook**

* Build a **repeatable wedge model**:

  * Cashola = service trades (Jobber).
  * Future clones = property management, gyms, logistics ERPs.
  * Oodaloo/Escher = general controller platform for any SMB on QBO.

* Over time:

  * Standardize policy engine → “SQL for controllership” (declarative finance).
  * Automate 60–70% of controller work, humans handle only exceptions.
  * Become the **tech-enabled fractional CFO firm at scale**.

---

## **Why This Works**

1. **Owner-centric wedge**: solve the *weekly cash anxiety*, not “bookkeeping hygiene.”
2. **Progression path**:

   * Cashola proves the ritual → revenue + proof.
   * Oodaloo/Escher scales it into a controller service for bigger firms.
3. **Distribution leverage**:

   * Jobber App Store → fast MVP reach.
   * QBO App Store → massive TAM, accountants channel.
   * ERPNext/vertical SaaS → experimental R\&D/secondary channels.
4. **Scalable ops model**:

   * Software handles the majority.
   * Offshore labor handles the mess.
   * ML handles the anomalies.

---

⚡ **One company → two brands**:

* **Cashola**: stays focused on trades, could be spun out/partnered.
* **Oodaloo/Escher**: the bigger “controller-as-a-service” platform.

Do you want me to also map this into a **12–18 month execution roadmap** (MVP → marketplace launch → QBO app build → offshore service layer → controller SaaS)? That would give you concrete milestones.

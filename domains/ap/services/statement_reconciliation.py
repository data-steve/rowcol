"""
Statement Reconciliation Service for Oodaloo

PURPOSE: Simple vendor statement reconciliation for single business owners
- Basic bill matching against vendor statements
- Simple discrepancy identification

SCOPE: Oodaloo Phase 3-4 (single business owner)
NOT: Complex multi-client reconciliation (that's RowCol complexity)

NOTE: Current tests appear to be RowCol-focused. This service provides
basic functionality to prevent import errors while we evaluate if
statement reconciliation features are needed for Oodaloo Phase 3-4.

# TODO: Phase 3-4 - Evaluate if Oodaloo needs reconciliation features
# - Do business owners need automated statement reconciliation?
# - Should this integrate with QBO bill matching?
# - What's the simplest UX for identifying discrepancies?

# PARKED for RowCol:
# - Multi-client statement processing
# - Complex discrepancy workflows
# - Advanced reconciliation reporting
# - Integration with CAS firm audit trails

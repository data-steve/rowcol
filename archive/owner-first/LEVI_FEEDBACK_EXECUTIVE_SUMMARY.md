# Executive Summary: Levi Morehouse Feedback

**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Source**: Levi Morehouse (President of Aiwyn.ai, Founder of Taxa.ai)  
**Impact**: Strategic pivot from owners to CAS firms as primary ICP

---

## **üéØ The Core Validation**

### **What Levi Said**
> "10,000% right - real need"

**Problem is validated**. Weekly cash call ritual is a real, unaddressed market opportunity.

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è The Reality Check**

### **Owner Adoption Challenge**
**Levi's Insight**: "The problem is getting owners to do the work"

**Why Owners Are Hard**:
- They check bank accounts daily, run everything from banks
- They won't enter missing bills into QBO
- Missing bills = wrong runway = broken trust = broken ritual

**Critical Success Factor**: Data completeness is make-or-break

---

## **üöÄ The Strategic Pivot**

### **OLD Strategy**
- **ICP**: Service agency owners ($1-5M revenue)
- **Distribution**: QBO App Store (direct-to-owner)
- **Pricing**: $99-$299/mo (premium positioning)
- **Positioning**: Agentic cash flow console with AI

### **NEW Strategy**
- **ICP**: CAS firms serving 20-100 clients
- **Distribution**: Direct sales + Aiwyn partnership
- **Pricing**: $50/mo per client ($30k ARR for 50-client firm)
- **Positioning**: Weekly cash call ritual automation

---

## **üí∞ The Pricing Reality**

**Levi's Guidance**:
- **$50/mo per client** - Realistic for CAS firms
- **Phase 0 + Smart AP** - Enough value for that price
- **No comment on agentic positioning** - Not critical for adoption

**What This Means**:
- Agentic positioning is nice-to-have, not must-have
- Core ritual + basic AP is sufficient for MVP
- Focus on reliability over AI messaging

---

## **üîë Critical Success Factors**

### **Data Completeness (Make or Break)**
1. **Bank Feed Integration** - Essential for complete cash picture
2. **Point of Sale Integration** - For accurate payroll estimation
3. **Missing Bill Detection** - Flag bills that should exist
4. **CAS Firm Data Entry** - They fill gaps owner won't

**Why This Is Critical**:
- Missing bills ‚Üí wrong runway ‚Üí lost trust ‚Üí churned customer
- CAS firms can ensure data completeness (they enter missing bills)
- Owners won't maintain complete data (they check bank accounts)

---

## **üìã Updated Priorities**

### **P0 CRITICAL: Data Completeness**
1. Bank feed integration (40h)
2. Missing bill detection (20h)
3. Multi-client dashboard for CAS firms (50h)

### **P1 HIGH: CAS Firm Features**
4. Data quality scoring (20h)
5. Point of sale integration (30h)
6. White-label option (30h)

### **P2 MEDIUM: Agentic Features** (DEPRIORITIZED)
7. Smart Policies/Budgets (90h) - Nice-to-have, not must-have

---

## **üéØ Why CAS Firms First**

**Levi's Insight**: CAS firms are used to buying one-off tools for specific needs

**Why It Works**:
- They buy tools ($50/mo per client is realistic)
- They ensure data completeness (enter missing bills)
- They enforce the ritual (client relationship)
- They need differentiation (as QBO automates hygiene)
- Weekly cash call is unaddressed opportunity

---

## **üí° Key Takeaways**

### **1. Problem Validated**
"10,000% right - real need" - We're solving the right problem

### **2. ICP Changed**
CAS firms first, owners second - They can ensure data completeness

### **3. Pricing Validated**
$50/mo per client is realistic - Scales with CAS firm growth

### **4. Product Scoped**
Core ritual + Smart AP is enough - Don't overcomplicate MVP

### **5. Success Factor Identified**
Data completeness is make-or-break - Bank feed integration essential

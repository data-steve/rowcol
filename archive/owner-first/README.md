# Owner-First Strategy Archive

**Date Archived**: 2025-09-30  
**Reason**: Strategic pivot to CAS firms as primary ICP based on Levi Morehouse feedback

## Why We Pivoted

### The Validation
**Levi Morehouse** (President of Aiwyn.ai, Founder of Taxa.ai) validated:
> "10,000% right - real need"

### The Reality Check
**Owner Adoption Challenge**:
- Owners check bank accounts daily, run everything from banks
- They won't enter missing bills into QBO
- Missing bills = wrong runway = broken trust = broken ritual

**Data Completeness Is Make-or-Break**:
- Bank feed integration essential
- Point of sale integration needed for payroll estimation
- CAS firms can ensure data completeness (they enter missing bills)
- Owners won't maintain complete data

### The Path Forward
**CAS Firms First, Owners Second**:
- CAS firms buy tools ($50/mo per client is realistic)
- They can ensure data completeness
- They have the relationship to enforce the ritual
- Weekly cash call is unaddressed opportunity in market

## What Changed

### ICP
**OLD**: Service agency owners ($1-5M revenue)  
**NEW**: CAS firms serving 20-100 clients

### Distribution
**OLD**: QBO App Store (direct-to-owner)  
**NEW**: Direct sales to CAS firms + Aiwyn partnership

### Pricing
**OLD**: $99-$299/mo (premium positioning)  
**NEW**: $50/mo per client ($30k ARR for 50-client firm)

### Product Focus
**OLD**: Agentic positioning with AI messaging (P0 CRITICAL)  
**NEW**: Data completeness and reliability (P0 CRITICAL)

### Build Priorities
**OLD**:
1. P0: Smart Policies/Budgets (agentic intelligence)
2. P1: AP/AR polish
3. P2: Multi-client dashboard

**NEW**:
1. P0: Bank feed integration (data completeness)
2. P0: Missing bill detection (data completeness)
3. P0: Multi-client dashboard (CAS firm capability)
4. P2: Smart Policies/Budgets (nice-to-have, not must-have)

## What Stayed The Same

### Architecture
- 3-layer pattern (orchestrators → calculators → experiences)
- OODA loop = agentic loop (still valid)
- domains/ for QBO primitives, runway/ for orchestration
- All code is multi-tenant ready (`business_id` scoping)

### Product Vision
- Weekly cash call ritual
- Must Pay vs Can Delay categorization
- One approval → batch QBO actions
- Runway-first orientation

### Technical Foundation
- Phase 0-2 mostly complete (222 files, 70 directories)
- QBO integration working
- AP/AR/Bank services implemented
- Ready for multi-tenant layer

## When Owner-First Might Return

### Q3 2026+ (After CAS Firm Validation)

**If**:
- CAS firms are proven (5-10 firms, 100-500 clients)
- Data completeness features are working
- Bank feed integration is solid
- Missing bill detection is reliable

**Then**:
- Launch owner self-serve via QBO App Store
- Price at $99/mo for single-client
- Require bank feed integration
- Target owners who maintain clean books

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Problem Validation
"10,000% right - real need" - The weekly cash call ritual IS the opportunity

### 2. Distribution Strategy
Direct-to-owner via QBO App Store is risky without data completeness

### 3. Pricing Reality
$50/mo per client scales better than $99/mo per owner

### 4. Product Positioning
CAS firms want reliability over AI buzzwords

### 5. Market Intelligence
One expert opinion (Levi) worth 100 customer interviews when:
- They run CAS firms for decades
- They build tools for accounting firms
- They're on the road pitching to top 500 firms
- They know what CAS firms buy and why

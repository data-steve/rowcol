# Oodaloo / RowCol — The Cash Runway Ritual

**Who it's for:**

* **PRIMARY**: CAS firms managing 20-100 client businesses (creative/marketing/IT, \$1–5M revenue, 10–30 staff) on QBO.
* **FUTURE**: Individual business owners (Phase 7+ via QBO App Store).

**Why CAS firms need it:**

* Cash flow swings weekly across their client portfolio: clients pay late, bills bunch up, payroll looms.
* CAS firms spend hours every week managing spreadsheets for each client just to decide what to pay or chase.
* **Data completeness challenge**: Individual owners won't maintain missing bills/data, but CAS firms will ensure quality.

## The Insight

**The Ritual**
Every week or two, CAS firm staff (and their client business owners) sit down to answer three questions across their client portfolio:

1. Which clients can cover upcoming payroll and core bills?
2. Which clients have late AR that need chasing?
3. Which vendors must each client pay now, and which can wait?

**Firm-first context**: CAS firms run this ritual for 20-100 clients simultaneously, identifying which clients are at runway risk and need immediate attention.

The ones who don't ask these questions end up asking harder ones later: *Why did we overcommit? Why can't I make payroll? How did cash disappear when sales look fine?*

It’s no surprise: **82% of small business failures are tied to cash flow issues** (U.S. Bank). **Two-thirds of SMBs say late payments hurt their business** (Intuit, *State of Small Business Cash Flow*), and **over half lose \$10k+ a year** from timing mismatches (CPA.com / Intuit surveys).

For those who *do* run the ritual, the frustration is the same: hours lost in spreadsheets, scattered reports, and judgment calls with no clear picture. Either way, the question persists: **isn’t there a better way to get weekly runway clarity?**

**The Gulf**
The problem is **CAS firms manage multiple clients across different ops tools, while each client's bookkeeper lives in QBO, where compliance happens.** Even though data flows into QBO, in practice there's still a gulf between those two worlds for each client.

```
[Client] Ops (Asana/ServiceTitan) ----> [Client Bookkeeper] Books (QBO) ----> [CPA] Taxes (UltraTax)
                                            /
                                           /
                           [CAS Firm] Multi-Client Runway (Spreadsheets today, RowCol tomorrow)
```

**Firm-first context**: CAS firms need to bridge this gulf across 20-100 clients simultaneously, not just one business.

---

**The Opportunity**
The cash runway ritual bridges that gulf. It's not ops, and it's not compliance—it connects each client's operations to their financial reality at the point of maximum relevance. It's the missing operating layer where CAS firms and their clients actually decide what gets paid and chased.

Is this QuickBooks by another name? Here's the key orientation: **QBO is journal-first, but RowCol is runway-first.** QBO cares that every credit and debit is properly booked; RowCol cares whether each client's payroll clears Friday.

When cash is thin, even the so-called "edge cases" matter. That's when software should unify the moving parts into one clear picture — how each business needs to run, not just how the books get recorded.

Yet no tool supports this ritual end-to-end across multiple clients. On the financial side, AR tools collect, AP tools pay, forecasting apps model, and QBO holds the ledger. But none bring **cash-in, cash-out, and cash-on-hand** together in one place where CAS firms can manage their entire client portfolio.

**RowCol productizes that missing multi-client financial-ops layer.**

The ritual is the perfect candidate for software:

* **PRIMARY**: Scalable enough for CAS firms to serve 20-100 clients with batch workflows
* **FUTURE**: Light enough for individual owners to self-serve (Phase 7+)
* Structured enough for firm staff to uplevel client advisory services

## Oodaloo — The Agentic Cash Flow Console

**Why "Oodaloo"?** From the OODA loop: *observe, orient, decide, act—rinse and repeat.* The same pattern modern AI agents use.

**Positioning**: Domain-specific AI agent for cash flow survival. Not a chatbot or autopilot—an intelligent system that stages decisions, you approve and execute.

For our ICP, Oodaloo automates the weekly cash runway ritual through agentic orchestration:

* **Friday Digest (Observe):** AI-generated overview with runway, late AR, AP due, and intelligent hygiene flagging.
* **Cash Console (Orient):** AI groups bills into *Must Pay* vs *Can Delay* by runway impact, prioritizes AR collections, stages earmark decisions.
* **Approve → Execute (Decide/Act):** One human approval triggers batch QBO actions—reminders, payments, reserves—orchestrated by AI.
* **Drift Alerts (Learn):** AI monitors reality vs plan, flags deviations, proposes corrections.

**The Win:** 80% automation with 100% control—owners get back 5–7 hours a week, avoid the 20–30% runway misses that sink agencies, while maintaining full trust through human-in-the-loop approval.

**Agentic Differentiation**: QBO agents handle task automation (categorize, reconcile). Oodaloo handles decision orchestration (compress, prioritize, optimize).

### Planned Modules (Agentic Feature Evolution)

* **Core Ritual (Agentic Foundation):** Weekly Email Digest, Cash Console, Hygiene Score, Prep Tray, Runway metric—already agentic through OODA loop implementation.
* **Smart AP (Agent Rules):** Earmarking, timeline conditional releases, vendor credit handling—AI learns payment preferences and auto-stages decisions.
* **Smart AR (Agent Collections):** Priorities, custom reminder drips, auto-pause on payment, match/clean deposits—AI optimizes collection timing by customer behavior.
* **Smart Budgets (Agent Constraints):** Guardrails for essential vs discretionary spend, vacation pre-planning, policy engine—AI enforces spending rules and learns from deviations. **THIS IS WHERE AGENTIC INTELLIGENCE BECOMES OBVIOUS.**
* **Analytics Pack (Agent Insights):** AR/AP aging trends, profit analysis, 2–4 week forecasts, shareable dashboards, benchmarking—AI predicts scenarios and recommends optimizations.

Oodaloo is modular by design. Not every client has complex AR or AP needs that justify tools like Ramp, but every firm needs the weekly cash runway ritual. Smaller CAS-only shops can use RowCol as their core operating console; larger firms can layer it on top of existing rails, using Ritual + Analytics as the shared judgment surface even when AP/AR execution happens elsewhere.

### Distribution Plan

**Phase 1: QBO Marketplace (Oodaloo)**
Oodaloo is the self-serve wedge:

* Owners and lone bookkeepers can adopt it directly from the QBO App Store.
* Expectations are lower: a clean weekly console is enough for immediate value.
* Each seat proves the model and builds design partners.

**Phase 2: CAS Firm Channel (RowCol)**
Once proven with owners, the same ritual becomes the wedge into firms:

* **RowCol Runway:** Batch weekly reviews, hygiene scoring, role-based access, audit trails.
* **RowCol Compliance Assist (future):** HITL transaction categorization & vendor normalization.
* **RowCol Close (future):** Monthly close workflows/checklists, fed by Oodaloo’s data exhaust.

**Note:** Keeper today is the best-known CAS-side tool, but it is compliance-first. As QBO’s new UI-triggered Agents automate bookkeeping hygiene, Keeper’s core gets squeezed. Firms will want to offer more defensible, client-facing services — and the weekly cash runway ritual is the obvious choice.

### Why Oodaloo / RowCol

**Why it works:** The weekly cash call is already viewed as controller-level, high-leverage work. Until now, only businesses with access to internal finance/external CAS teams had the capacity to do it consistently.

Oodaloo productizes the ritual on top of QBO rails:

* **QBO App Store:** high-intent buyers searching “cash flow.”
* **CAS firms:** fastest-growing service line, needing weekly proof of value.
* **Owners:** willing to pay more for judgment-driven tools than dashboards—because this ties directly to payroll and peace of mind.

At the nexus of cash-in, cash-out, and cash-on-hand, Oodaloo and RowCol stand where owners and accounting pros meet every week. That makes them indispensable—and gives them pricing power—while incumbents remain focused on tax and compliance.

**Why now (and why it's durable):** Even as QBO adds agents and automation for bookkeeping hygiene, those features **strengthen the inputs.** Oodaloo focuses on the **judgment moment**—compressing AR/AP timing and runway into a single **owner approval that executes.** 

**Agentic positioning is defensible**: QBO agents handle task-level automation (journal-first, compliance-driven). Oodaloo's agentic console handles decision-level orchestration (runway-first, survival-driven). These are complementary layers, not competing products. QBO agents clean the pipes; Oodaloo decides what flows through.

CAS firms benefit as low-value categorization is automated by QBO agents; Oodaloo/RowCol elevates their weekly advisory with agentic decision orchestration and feeds a cleaner month-end close.

### Questions / Risks

* **Adoption & behavior change:** Will owners self-serve, or will usage skew toward bookkeepers/CAS firms running the ritual on clients’ behalf?
* **Buyer clarity:** Who is the long-term buyer — the owner, the firm, or both?
* **Distribution reality:** Does QBO Marketplace drive real adoption, or is CAS/bookkeeper distribution the true growth engine?
* **Durability of the ritual:** Is the weekly runway ritual powerful enough — with AP/AR, budgeting, and analytics — to anchor an enduring app, or will firms still see it as “just another tool”?

"""
Runway Reserve End-to-End Integration Test

CRITICAL TEST: Proves runway reserve calculations work with real QBO data.

This test validates that our Phase 0 foundation (runway calculations, QBO integration,
data quality analysis) actually works together to produce accurate runway reserves
using real QBO API data, not mocks.

Success here proves Phase 1 Smart AP can be built on solid foundations.

"""
Phase 0 Core Functionality Tests

These tests focus ONLY on the Phase 0 MVP components:
- Business model (single business)
- User model (single user per business) 
- Basic database functionality
- Core imports and structure

Tests for parked features (payments, jobs, advanced reconciliation, etc.) 
are intentionally excluded and will be addressed in later phases.

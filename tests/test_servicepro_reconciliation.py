ServicePro Reconciliation Tests

Tests the real-world complexity that contractors face:
- Bundled payments across multiple jobs
- Period mismatches (work in Jan, paid in Feb)
- Shared expenses across multiple jobs
- Progress billing on long-term projects

This validates our reconciliation engine against scenarios that make
accountants fall back to Excel.

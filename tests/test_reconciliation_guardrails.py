Reconciliation Guardrail Tests

These are the basic sanity checks that should NEVER fail.
If any of these tests fail, there's a fundamental logic error
that would make the system unusable in production.

These tests catch obvious bugs like:
- Variance calculations that don't make mathematical sense
- Total amounts that don't balance
- Confidence scores outside valid ranges
- Missing required data fields

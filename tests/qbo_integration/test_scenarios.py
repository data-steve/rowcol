"""
QBO Integration Test Scenarios - Comprehensive Sandbox Testing

These scenarios test the core assumption that Oodaloo can become the source of truth 
for business owners' finances using QBO as the backend.

Key Questions to Answer:
1. Can we accurately calculate cash runway from QBO data?
2. Can we orchestrate "single approval â†’ multiple actions" workflows?
3. Can we maintain sync accuracy with real-time QBO changes?
4. Can we normalize vendor data for accurate reporting?

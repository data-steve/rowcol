Shared Expense Allocation Engine for Service Contractors - V1

This engine solves the complex problem of identifying and allocating expenses that
span multiple jobs - one of the most challenging aspects of contractor accounting.

The Reality Contractors Face:
- Equipment rentals used across multiple job sites
- Bulk material purchases (concrete, lumber) delivered to various projects  
- Fuel costs for crews working on different jobs
- Shared overhead like insurance, utilities, and administrative costs
- Professional services (engineering, permits) that benefit multiple projects

Core Business Challenge:
Without proper allocation, contractors can't:
1. Accurately calculate job profitability
2. Price future jobs correctly
3. Identify which projects are actually profitable
4. Make informed business decisions about resource allocation

Algorithm Architecture:

1. **Pattern-Based Identification**: Uses comprehensive keyword matching across
   transaction descriptions, vendor names, and account codes to identify potentially
   shared expenses. The system recognizes 100+ industry-specific terms.

2. **Smart Allocation Method Selection**: Six distinct allocation strategies based
   on expense characteristics:
   - by_usage_days: Equipment/tools (excavators, generators, scaffolding)
   - by_crew_hours: Labor-intensive costs (fuel, PPE, transportation)
   - by_job_size: Materials scaling with scope (concrete, lumber, roofing)
   - by_job_complexity: Professional services (engineering, permits, inspections)
   - by_project_duration: Timeline-based costs (insurance, storage, utilities)
   - equal_split: True overhead costs (office, admin, software)

3. **Confidence Scoring**: Each allocation suggestion includes a confidence score
   based on pattern match strength, helping accountants prioritize review time.

4. **Learnable System**: New expense patterns can be added dynamically, allowing
   the system to adapt to company-specific terminology and evolving business needs.

5. **Temporal Job Matching**: Only allocates expenses to jobs that were active
   during the expense period (with reasonable buffer for timing differences).

Key Design Principles:
- **Transparency**: Every allocation decision includes detailed rationale
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new patterns without code changes
- **Flexibility**: Multiple allocation methods suit different expense types
- **Accuracy**: Sophisticated pattern matching reduces false positives
- **Scalability**: Efficient algorithms handle hundreds of jobs and transactions

The system prioritizes accuracy over automation - when in doubt, it flags expenses
for manual review rather than making incorrect allocations that could distort
job profitability analysis.

Future Enhancements:
- Machine learning from historical allocation decisions
- Integration with job characteristics (square footage, crew size, duration)
- Automated allocation based on actual usage data from equipment/time tracking
- Integration with vendor catalogs for better expense categorization

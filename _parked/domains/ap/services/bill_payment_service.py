Bill Payment Service - Parked for Future Ramp Implementation

This service contains payment execution methods that were moved from
domains/ap/services/bill_ingestion.py to maintain QBO-honest architecture.

QBO is only a ledger rail - it cannot execute payments.
These methods will be implemented by Ramp when payment execution is enabled.

"""
Revenue Recognition Engine for Service Contractors - V1

This engine handles the complex accrual accounting logic for recognizing revenue
when work is performed versus when cash is received - a critical distinction
for accurate financial reporting and job profitability analysis.

The Revenue Recognition Challenge:
Service contractors face unique timing challenges that traditional accounting
software doesn't handle well:
- Work performed in March, invoice sent in April, payment received in May
- Progress billing on long-term projects with milestone-based payments
- Percentage-of-completion revenue recognition for multi-month jobs
- Period-end cutoffs that require accruals and deferrals
- Job costs incurred before revenue recognition triggers

GAAP Compliance Requirements:
The engine implements multiple revenue recognition methods per accounting standards:
1. **Cash Basis**: Revenue recognized when payment received (simple contractors)
2. **Accrual Basis**: Revenue recognized when work performed (most contractors)
3. **Percentage Completion**: Revenue recognized based on work progress (long projects)
4. **Milestone Method**: Revenue recognized at specific completion points

Algorithm Architecture:

1. **Work Period Analysis**: 
   - Analyzes job line items to determine when work was actually performed
   - Handles jobs with detailed time tracking vs. estimated completion
   - Creates monthly work-performed summaries

2. **Cash Period Analysis**:
   - Maps payments to specific periods when cash was received
   - Accounts for payment processor fees affecting net amounts
   - Handles timing differences between invoice dates and payment dates

3. **Variance Calculation**:
   - Identifies periods where work performed â‰  cash received
   - Flags significant variances requiring accounting adjustments
   - Generates accrual/deferral recommendations

4. **Journal Entry Generation**:
   - Creates proper accounting entries for period-end adjustments
   - Handles accounts receivable accruals for completed work
   - Manages deferred revenue for prepayments

5. **Recognition Method Selection**:
   - Automatically selects appropriate method based on job characteristics
   - Considers job duration, payment terms, and billing complexity
   - Prioritizes percentage completion for progress-billed projects

This service ensures contractors can:
- Generate accurate monthly financial statements
- Calculate true job profitability by period
- Meet GAAP requirements for revenue recognition
- Handle complex project billing scenarios correctly

# Oodaloo — Unified Strategy & Summary (PE‑ready, CFO/PE lens)

## One‑line

**Profit clarity, powered by automation.**
Bank feeds in. Profit clarity out. Smart matching, you approve.

---

## Executive summary

* **Positioning:** Jobber/Housecall Pro (ops) and QuickBooks (accounting) don’t deliver **bank‑verified, weekly profit & payroll runway**. Oodaloo is the **missing financial operating layer** for service businesses—especially HVAC and adjacent trades at 5–30 techs.
* **Core promise:** 70%+ of payouts and expenses **auto‑matched** from bank/card feeds and Jobber data. A dispatcher clears the rest in **<10 minutes/week**. Outcomes: **cash job GM**, **ranked AR plan**, **payroll runway**—that owners can trust.
* **Profit loop:** (1) collect the right AR → (2) runway extends → (3) spend & scheduling decisions → (4) exceptions cleared → repeat. Oodaloo **operationalizes** this loop; ops suites don’t.
* **Marketplace‑safe:** *Jobber runs your jobs. Oodaloo makes the cash clear.*

## Framing & gap (CFO/PE view)

* **Framing:** Jobber/HCP is for operations. QuickBooks is for accounting. **Oodaloo is for profit**—bank‑truth visibility and action between the two.
* **Gap:** Ops suites show **modeled margin** (manual cost entry); accountants **close historical books**. Owners need **bank‑verified profit and payroll runway weekly**, without hiring a controller. Oodaloo ties **bank deposits ↔ invoices ↔ costs & labor** and compresses the workflow to an exceptions tray and a Friday digest.

## What Oodaloo actually does (modules)

### 1) Accounts Receivable (AR) — cash‑verified

* **Unbundle payouts** (e.g., JobberPay/Stripe) into invoices + fees; stop chasing already‑paid invoices.
* Produce a **Top‑N to collect** plan ranked by *amount × age × likelihood* with **runway impact** (e.g., “+0.8 weeks if you collect these 3”).

### 2) Job Costs / AP — automated COGS

* **Auto‑suggest expense tagging** from card/ACH transactions to jobs/vendors; you approve.
* Apply **labor burden** (timesheets or burden factors) and show **cash job GM** (winners/losers).
* **AP hygiene:** duplicate/fee catchers; delay‑OK nudges on large debits.

### 3) Real‑time Observability — decision surface

* **Exceptions tray**: fast, keyboard‑first triage (confirm, split, assign, ignore). Designed for a dispatcher to clear in **minutes**.
* **Friday digest**: cash job winners/losers, runway, Top‑N AR, and data‑health.

### 4) Benchmarking — criteria‑based (vertical + stage)

* Ship **defaults by trade and stage** (Growth vs Mature) for GM%, labor%, ad spend%, overhead bands.
* Owners can **lock targets** (“what good looks like”), and we grade weekly actuals vs bands.
* Different from peer medians: we use **recipes/criteria** that match HVAC/installer vs recurring route work.

### 5) QBD‑style reporting UX — persistent context

* **Never lose filters** on drilldown/edit (CFO‑friendly). Side‑drawer transaction edits with instant recompute.
* **Owner vs Dispatcher modes:** Owner consumes digest + approvals; dispatcher handles exceptions and retagging.
* This is strategy, not a rebuild of ops—**it’s financial visibility that sticks**.

### 6) Data portability — your data is yours

* One‑click **full exports** (CSV/Parquet/JSONL), schedulable + webhookable.
* Oodaloo respects **local ownership** so PE diligence can run off‑platform if needed.

## Profit loop (make it explicit in product & messaging)

1. **Collect** the right AR (bank‑truth stops ghosts) → runway extends.
2. **See** extended runway → confidence to schedule, staff, buy.
3. **Focus** on high‑GM jobs → cash winners/losers are visible.
4. **Clear** exceptions fast → trust compounds.
5. **Repeat weekly** → discipline = profit.

> This is not a “report.” It’s an **operating loop**.

## ICP & segmentation (with PE overlay)

| Size (techs) |    Revenue | Typical platform              | PE activity    | Oodaloo unlock                                               |
| ------------ | ---------: | ----------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1–5          | \$0.5–\$2M | Jobber Core/Connect, HCP      | Pre‑PE micro   | Profit digest, AR cleanup, basic runway                      |
| 5–15         | \$2.5–\$8M | Jobber Grow/Scale; some HCP   | Pre‑PE growth  | Bank‑truth job GM, AR plan, payout unbundling, weekly runway |
| 15–30        |  \$5–\$10M | Mix Jobber/HCP; some early ST | Prime tuck‑ins | Clean optics + runway → faster diligence                     |
| 30+          |     \$10M+ | ST dominant                   | Platform deals | Optional ST companion later (bank‑truth overlay)             |

**Practical read:** ST “owns” after consolidation. Tuck‑ins are often on Jobber/HCP—**exactly** where Oodaloo helps—and it **extends Jobber/HCP’s runway** pre‑migration.

## Marketplace‑safe messaging (blink‑level)

* **Tagline:** *Profit clarity, powered by automation.*
* **Sub‑line:** *Bank feeds in. Profit clarity out. Smart matching, you approve.*
* **Bullets:** Auto‑unbundle payouts → **real AR** · Auto‑tag expenses → **cash job GM** · Weekly digest → **payroll runway**

---

## Competitive posture (non‑adversarial)

* **Ops suites excel at** scheduling, quoting, client comms, basic invoicing, time tracking, **manual** job costing.
* **Accounting excels at** period close and tax.
* **Oodaloo excels at** cash verification, automation‑assisted tagging, AR prioritization by runway, and auditability—**the financial operating layer in between**.

---

## Adoption barriers & mitigations (owner reality)

* “**I have a bookkeeper**.” → Oodaloo is **real‑time, bank‑truth**; exports make the bookkeeper look better.
* “**Another inbox?**” → Dispatcher clears exceptions **<10 min/week**; owner reads the Friday digest.
* “**Bad reports burned me**.” → Lead with **bank‑matched** transparency; first sync shows why “platform AR ≠ bank.”
* “**I just check my bank app**.” → Reframe: **balance ≠ runway**.

---

## Where we stand vs Jobber (what we need from them)

* **Data in:** invoices, jobs, clients, line items, timesheets, payments; link to Jobber Payments payouts.
* **Data out (light write‑back):** call attempts / notes on invoices; optional custom field touch so ops sees context.
* **Complement, don’t compete:** We don’t touch dispatch, quoting, or client comms; we **clarify the cash**.

---

## What’s unique to Oodaloo (why PE cares)

* **Pre‑controller leverage:** Turns a \$3–\$10M contractor into a **cash‑coherent target** without extra headcount.
* **Diligence‑ready optics:** Bank‑matched AR, runway trendlines, exception/audit logs.
* **Roll‑up synergy:** Keeps tuck‑ins performant on Jobber/HCP **before** and **during** ST migrations.

**Owner pain checklist:** Payroll >\$100k/mo · Materials >\$1M/yr · AR ballooning · Controller out of reach · “Bank balance ≠ runway” anxiety.
If ≥2 are true, Oodaloo lands fast.

## Strategy additions based on the Micah/Carrington convo

**1) QBD‑style UX & reporting (strategy):**

* Promise **persistent context** and **fast, editable drilldowns**—the CFO can trust the view isn’t fragile.
* Keep the UI minimal: digest first, side‑drawer edits, URL‑shareable states for coaching.

**2) Criteria‑based benchmarking (strategy):**

* Ship **vertical/stage recipes** (HVAC, Plumbing, Cleaning, Lawn/Pool; Growth vs Mature) for GM%, labor%, ad spend%, overhead.
* Owners **lock targets**; Oodaloo coaches against those bands weekly.

**3) Export & portability (strategy):**

* Market **“your data is yours.”** Full, durable exports, schedulable; webhook delivery for CFO/PE workflows.

**4) Accounting integration layer (strategy):**

* Optional QBO/Wave push (summary JEs later). Our core is **bank/processor unbundling** + **exception engine** for a clean cash view.

---

## Go‑to‑market

* **Land:** Jobber App Marketplace: *“Profit clarity, powered by automation.”* Free 14‑day trial; guided onboarding; instant digest when first payout is unbundled.
* **Expand:** Add Job Costing and AP Assist modules post‑AR win. Invite the bookkeeper with read‑only access.
* **Prove ROI:** Show weekly **runway delta** from Top‑N collections; show **auto‑match %** and minutes saved.

---

## Success definition (owner quote we’re aiming for)

> “I know if payroll is covered, which jobs are winners, and exactly which invoices move runway this week.”

## Appendix — FAQ for market conversations

* **Does Jobber already do job costing/profitability?** Yes—**manual entry** for materials/expenses and labor via timesheets. Oodaloo **automates** the cost capture from bank/card feeds, reconciles payouts, and frames it as **runway** and **job cash GM**.
* **How much data can we take out of Jobber?** Per‑report **Export to CSV** (emailed) is supported broadly; APIs (GraphQL) exist for programmatic access. For marketplace safety, we position as **augmenting** data access owners already have, not replacing Jobber.
* **Do we replace QBO?** No. We create **bank‑truth operating visibility** and optionally export/push summaries so books stay consistent. QBO remains the system of record for tax and accrual.

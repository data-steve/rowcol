# Oodaloo — Profit Clarity for Service Pros


### Framing

* Jobber/HCP is for operations
* QuickBooks is for accounting
* Oodaloo is for profit clarity

### One-liner: Bank-truth profit, payroll runway, and financial automations for service pros.


## The Gap Oodaloo Fills


* Ops platforms (Jobber, Housecall Pro, ServiceTitan) show modeled revenue, not bank-matched profit.
* Accounting systems (QBO, CPAs, controllers) deliver historical closes, often accrual-based and months late.
* App marketplaces: \

    * Jobber/HCP: primarily marketing/scheduling tools, no financial decision layer.
    * QBO: dominated by bookkeeper support tools.
    * Nothing connects the two — this is where Oodaloo fits.

Owners are left checking bank balances and gut feel to decide if payroll is covered.Oodaloo ties it together:

* Bank deposits → Jobber invoices → costs & labor
* Weekly digest: job winners/losers, payroll runway, prioritized AR plan
* Dispatcher tray: mismatches resolved in minutes (confirm, split, assign, ignore) \


## What Oodaloo Does


### Accounts Receivable

* Unbundles processor deposits → clean AR aging
* Surfaces ranked “Top N to Collect” tied to runway impact
* Proven parallel: e-commerce startups built entirely around unbundling Shopify/Amazon payouts \


### Job Costs / AP

* Tags materials and labor burden to jobs
* Creates operational COGS view without full AP system \


### Observability Layer

* Dispatcher clears exceptions weekly (&lt;10 min)
* Friday digest: runway, AR at risk, job winners/losers, bank vs Jobber gaps, AR priorities \


### Succession-Ready Close (future)

* PE buyers often want 2–3 years of accrual-based, professionalized books
* Step-up requires consulting or bookkeeping involvement
* Oodaloo core provides profit clarity; optional service layers bridge to acquisition-ready optics \



## Why This Matters / Who It Serves

* Pre-controller leverage: $3–10M firms gain financial optics without extra headcount
* Audit/diligence readiness: bank-matched AR and payroll clarity reduce headaches
* Platform runway: extend Jobber/HCP usefulness before migrating to ServiceTitan \


### Segments

* Recurring SMBs (cleaning, lawn, pool): AR + unbundling pain first
* Installer/heavy trades (HVAC, plumbing, electrical): job costing + AR planning as they scale
* Promise: whether bleeding cash on jobs or chasing phantom AR, Oodaloo shows bank-truth profit and payroll runway \


## Order of Components

1. Unbundling (foundation)
    * Break net processor deposits into invoices + fees
    * Bank-truth reconciliation = trust restored
    * Required for both AR accuracy (recurring) and job costing (episodic)

2. AR Planning (Cash Discipline)
    * Reliable AR aging once unbundled
    * Rank/prioritize collections → “Collect top N invoices = +1.2 weeks runway”

3.Job Costing (Profit Clarity)
    * Tie materials + labor to jobs
    * Show cash GM: winners/losers
    * Harder to automate, needs exception tray

4. AP Assist (Optional)
    * Nudges around outgoing cash: vendor debits, duplicates, delay-OK, assign-to-job suggestions

5. Succession-Ready Close (Service Overlay)
    * Step from cash-basis clarity to accrual optics
    * Two years of professionalized books = PE-ready
    * Likely requires consulting/bookkeeping on top of SaaS core \


## Path Forward

* Phased delivery: build components in sequence, starting where pain is sharpest and automation is most achievable.
    * Early adopters: value from reconciliation and AR collections discipline.
    * Scaling firms: rely on job costing and AP support as complexity increases.
    * Ambitious firms: adopt succession-ready packages to reach PE-grade optics. 

* Current focus: refining both desirability (what owners/bookkeepers actually want) and doability (what can be reliably automated) to keep the vision tractable and Oodaloo clear about what it is today while showing a credible path forward.

# Oodaloo v5.1: Agentic Cash Flow Console Build Plan

**Version**: 5.1 (Agentic Positioning Update)  
**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Updated From**: v4.5 Restructured Build Plan  
**Critical Changes**: 
- **REPOSITIONED**: Oodaloo as "Agentic Cash Flow Console" (not just "cash runway tool")
- **ARCHITECTURE**: OODA loop recognized as agentic loop (already implemented!)
- **PRIORITY SHIFT**: Smart Policies/Budgets now CRITICAL (Phase 2.5, makes intelligence obvious)
- **QBO STRATEGY**: Positioned as complementary to QBO agents (not competing)
- **CURRENT STATUS**: Phase 0 complete, Phase 1 mostly complete, ready for agentic features

---

## **🎯 Strategic Positioning: Agentic Cash Flow Console**

### **What Changed (Critical)**

**OLD Positioning**: "Weekly cash runway ritual tool"
**NEW Positioning**: "Agentic cash flow console that automates your weekly runway decisions"

**Why This Matters**:
- **Oodaloo IS already agentic** - OODA loop = agentic loop (Sense → Think → Act → Review)
- **QBO agents launching Nov 2025+** - we need defensible positioning NOW
- **Premium pricing** - "AI-powered" commands $99-$299/mo vs basic tools
- **Market differentiation** - "Decision orchestration" vs "task automation"

### **The Agentic Loop (Already Implemented!)**

```
1. SENSE (Observe) - Data Orchestrators ✅ COMPLETE
   └─ Pull AR/AP/balance from QBO via SmartSyncService
   
2. THINK (Orient) - Calculators ✅ COMPLETE
   └─ Analyze runway impact, prioritize by survival

3. ACT (Decide) - Experience Services ✅ COMPLETE
   └─ Stage Must Pay/Can Delay for approval

4. REVIEW (Act) - Human Approval ✅ COMPLETE
   └─ One approval → execute batch to QBO
   └─ Drift alerts monitor reality vs plan
```

**INSIGHT**: We don't need to "build AI" - we need to **position what we have** and add **Smart Policies** to make the intelligence obvious.

## **🎨 Agentic Messaging Guidelines**

### **DO Use** ✅:
- "AI-powered weekly cash call"
- "Intelligent decision staging"
- "AI learns your payment preferences"
- "Smart runway optimization"
- "AI confidence: 92%"
- "Based on your past approvals"
- "AI protecting your runway"

### **DON'T Use** ❌:
- "AI chatbot" (not conversational)
- "Autopilot" (human approval required)
- "Replace your CFO" (we assist)
- "Fully autonomous" (human-in-the-loop)
- "AI recommendations" (legal risk - not financial advisors)

### **Legal Compliance** ⚖️:
- NEVER use "recommendations" or "advice"
- ALWAYS use "insights", "data shows", "tools to help you decide"
- Users make all decisions - we provide information and analysis

## **💡 The Bottom Line**

**Oodaloo IS an agentic system** - the OODA loop we built IS the agentic loop. We just need to:

1. ✅ **Position it that way** (docs updated, UI copy next)
2. 🔄 **Build Smart Policies** (Phase 2.5 - CRITICAL - makes intelligence obvious)
3. 📋 **Scale to RowCol** (Phase 5 - multi-client agentic console)

**The architecture is right. The strategy is clear. Smart Policies is the unlock.**

## When to Use This Template

**When to Promote Working Docs to ADRs:**
- **Architectural decisions are stable** - no more changes expected
- **Patterns are proven** - have been implemented and tested
- **Hard won wisdom** - decisions that required significant iteration
- **Reusable patterns** - other developers need to follow these patterns
- **Verification commands exist** - can be automatically checked

**ADR Promotion Process:**
1. **Working doc contains stable architectural decision**
2. **Create ADR-XXX in `docs/architecture/`**
3. **Use this ADR template** - status, decision, implementation, examples, verification
4. **Archive working doc** - move to `archive/` folder
5. **Update references** - point to new ADR location

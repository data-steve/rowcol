## **üöÄ Progress Update (5 min)**

### **What We Built**
- **Product**: Working MVP with QBO integration
- **Status**: Core features complete, ready for intelligence layer
- **Key Insight**: "We realized we're already agentic - OODA loop = agentic loop"

### **Current Capabilities**
- ‚úÖ **Weekly Digest**: Automated runway analysis and hygiene flagging
- ‚úÖ **Cash Console**: Must Pay vs Can Delay categorization with runway impact
- ‚úÖ **One-Click Approval**: Batch actions to QBO (payments, reminders, reserves)
- ‚úÖ **QBO Integration**: Real-time sync with accounting data

**The Aha Moment**: We don't need to "build AI" - we need to position what we have and add Smart Policies to make the intelligence obvious.

## **üéØ Strategic Pivot (5 min)**

### **OLD Positioning**
"Weekly cash runway ritual tool"

### **NEW Positioning** 
"Agentic cash flow console that automates weekly runway decisions"

### **Why This Matters**
- **QBO agents launching Nov 2025+** - need defensible positioning NOW
- **Premium pricing** - "AI-powered" commands $99-$299/mo vs basic tools
- **Market differentiation** - "Decision orchestration" vs "task automation"

### **The Differentiation**
```
QBO Agents (Task-Level):
- Categorize transactions
- Reconcile accounts  
- Suggest individual payments
- Journal-first, compliance-driven

Oodaloo (Decision-Level):
- Compress AP/AR/runway into one view
- Prioritize by runway impact
- Stage batch decisions for approval
- Runway-first, survival-driven
```

**Position**: "QBO agents clean the pipes; Oodaloo decides what flows through"

---

## **üìä Current Status (5 min)**

### **What's Working Now**
- ‚úÖ **Core Ritual**: Weekly email digest with runway analysis
- ‚úÖ **Decision Console**: AP/AR prioritization and staging
- ‚úÖ **QBO Actions**: Automated payments, reminders, reserves
- ‚úÖ **Data Quality**: Hygiene scoring and exception flagging

### **Next Critical Development**
**Smart Policies/Budgets** - Makes agentic intelligence obvious:
- AI learns payment preferences from user behavior
- Budget constraints with automatic enforcement  
- Vacation Mode (auto-pilot for essential payments)
- "AI confidence" indicators on recommendations

### **Timeline**
- **6-8 weeks** to intelligence layer MVP
- **Q1 2026** for full agentic capabilities

## **üí¨ Feedback & Discussion (10 min)**

### **Levi's Key Insights** ‚úÖ

**Market Reality**:
- **"10,000% right - real need"** - The problem is validated
- **Owner adoption challenge**: "They just check bank account daily and run everything out of banks"
- **Data completeness risk**: "If you don't get all the big bills they never entered into QBO, you'll lose faith"

**Critical Success Factors**:
- **Bank feed integration** - Essential for complete picture
- **Point of sale integration** - For accurate payroll estimation
- **Data completeness** - Missing bills = broken trust = broken ritual

**Pricing & Market**:
- **$50/mo per client** - Realistic pricing for CAS firms
- **Phase 0 + Smart AP** - Enough value for that price point
- **CAS firms buy tools** - They're used to one-off purchases for specific needs

### **Strategic Pivot Based on Feedback**

**OLD Strategy**: Direct to owners via QBO App Store
**NEW Strategy**: CAS firms first, owners second

**Why This Works**:
- CAS firms already buy tools for specific needs
- They can ensure data completeness (enter missing bills)
- They have the relationship to enforce the ritual
- $50/mo per client is realistic for their budget

---

## **ü§ù Partnership Discussion (5 min)**

### **What We're Looking For**

**Advisory**:
- Strategic guidance on CAS firm go-to-market
- Feedback on data integration requirements (bank feeds, POS)
- Regular check-ins as we build (monthly calls)

**Design Partners**:
- Introduction to 2-3 CAS firms for design partner conversations
- Access to firms already doing weekly cash calls
- Feedback on $50/mo pricing and feature requirements

**Strategic Input**:
- Design influence on CAS firm features
- Market intelligence on data completeness needs
- Integration requirements for bank feeds and POS systems

### **What We Can Offer**
- Early access to product as we build
- Input on features that would benefit your network
- Potential integration opportunities with Aiwyn
- Regular updates on progress and learnings

### **NDA Discussion**
- Currently under "friendDA" - no formal protection yet
- Would like to establish proper NDA if advisory relationship moves forward
- Happy to discuss confidentiality terms that work for both sides

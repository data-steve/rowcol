# S05: MVP Product-to-Code Alignment Framework

## Problem Statement
**CRITICAL MISSING MIDDLE LAYER**: We have a massive gap between our high-level vision docs and low-level code/tasks. We lack the concrete definition of what the QBO MVP actually does and how the software should implement it, making it impossible to validate if our code is correct or fix what's broken.

**Root Cause**: We've been asking broken code for guidance instead of defining what it should do first. We have:
- **Top level**: Vision docs (too abstract)
- **Bottom level**: Code and tasks (too specific) 
- **MISSING MIDDLE**: Concrete product definition + technical implementation spec

**Impact**: 
- Cannot validate if code matches product needs
- Cannot test if MVP actually works
- Cannot fix architectural misalignments
- Keep discovering gaps because we lack the definition to check against

## User Story
As a developer building the QBO MVP, I need a concrete definition of what the digest spreadsheet shows and how the software should implement it, so that I can validate our code against this definition and fix what's broken instead of patching symptoms.

## Solution Overview
Create the missing middle layer that bridges product vision to code implementation:

1. **Define the MVP Product** - What the digest spreadsheet actually shows (data, calculations, workflows)
2. **Map Technical Implementation** - End-to-end data flow from QBO to UI with clear patterns
3. **Create Validation Framework** - Checklist to verify code matches definition
4. **Fix Misalignments** - Update code to match the definition
5. **Establish Living Process** - Keep definition and code in sync

## Execution Status
- **Type**: Solutioning Task
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Missing middle layer fully defined
- **Estimated Effort**: 0 hours (architecture complete)
- **Priority**: P0 (foundational for all other work)
- **Resolution Date**: 2025-01-27

## Architecture Resolution
**✅ RESOLVED**: The DATA_ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md and MVP_DATA_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md provide the complete missing middle layer:

### **MVP Product Definition (Defined)**
- **Digest Experience**: Weekly cash call dashboard with runway calculations, cash position, bills due, invoices expected
- **Hygiene Tray**: Data quality issues across client portfolio (incomplete fields, missing data)
- **Decision Console**: Bills and invoices ready for decision across client portfolio
- **Multi-Client View**: Aggregate data across 20-100 clients for advisor portfolio management

### **Technical Implementation Spec (Defined)**
- **Three-Layer Architecture**: Data mirroring, sync orchestration, service boundaries
- **Data Flow Patterns**: Read operations (fast), sync operations (background), live operations (real-time)
- **Service Boundaries**: Domain services, data orchestrators, runway services
- **Progressive Implementation**: QBO-only MVP → Add Ramp → Add Plaid → Add Stripe

### **Validation Framework (Defined)**
- **Performance**: <3 seconds dashboard load for 100 clients
- **Reliability**: 99.9% availability, graceful error handling
- **Data Freshness**: 95% of data within 15 minutes of source
- **Architecture Compliance**: Clear service boundaries, proper data flow

### **Implementation Plan (Defined)**
- **Phase 1**: Build sync infrastructure and fix domain services (Week 1)
- **Phase 2**: Remove execution code and fix service boundaries (Week 2)
- **Phase 3**: End-to-end testing and performance optimization (Week 3)

### **Living Process (Defined)**
- **Architecture Spec**: DATA_ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md as source of truth
- **Build Plan**: MVP_DATA_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md for implementation
- **Progressive Implementation**: Architecture supports incremental development

## Success Criteria
- **Clear MVP Definition** - ✅ What the digest spreadsheet shows and how it works
- **Technical Implementation Spec** - ✅ End-to-end data flow with clear patterns
- **Validation Framework** - ✅ Checklist to verify code matches definition
- **Fixed Misalignments** - ✅ Concrete implementation plan to fix code
- **Living Process** - ✅ Architecture spec as source of truth

## Next Steps
1. **✅ S05 Complete** - Missing middle layer fully defined
2. **Resume S02** - Data Orchestrator Architecture Fix (implementation tasks)
3. **Resume S01** - QBO Sandbox Testing Strategy (now that architecture is solid)

## Related Tasks
- **S01**: QBO Sandbox Testing Strategy (ON HOLD - waiting for architecture completion)
- **S02**: Data Orchestrator Architecture Fix (ON HOLD - waiting for S05 completion)
- **S03**: SmartSyncService Architecture Fix (✅ COMPLETED)
- **S04**: Data Ownership Strategy (✅ RESOLVED by architecture docs)

*The missing middle layer is now fully defined. The architecture bridges product requirements to code implementation with concrete patterns and implementation plans.*

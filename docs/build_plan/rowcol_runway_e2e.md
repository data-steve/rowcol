# RowCol Runway End-to-End Build Plan

This document provides a detailed, end-to-end build plan for the RowCol `runway/` product, reorienting the Oodaloo cash runway ritual (`build_plan_v5.md`) for advisors managing 20-50 clients. It maps all tasks from `build_plan_v5.md` to RowCol phases, categorizing them as preserved, adapted, deferred, or excluded, while delivering a simplified Phase 1 MVP (client list, Digest, Hygiene, Console) with advisor-first scoping. Smart features (e.g., runway reserve, impact calculator, 3-stage collections) are deferred to Phase 2, preserved via feature flags (`basic_ritual_only`, `smart_features_enabled`) without `runway/parked/`. The plan aligns with `ADVISOR_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `COMPREHENSIVE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the `runway/` directory tree, using Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (prod), and Poetry. Tasks match the granularity of `build_plan_v5.md` with user stories, acceptance criteria, subtasks, effort estimates (S: <8h, M: 8-16h, L: 16-24h), dependencies, and validation steps.

## Phase 1: Core Cash Runway Ritual
**Goal**: Deliver simplified MVP ($50/client/month) for advisors, replacing spreadsheets with client list and 3-tab view (Digest, Hygiene, Console), scoped by advisor_id. Gate smart features with `basic_ritual_only` (per `2_SMART_FEATURES_REFERENCE.md`). Leverage `infra/qbo/` for QBO integration (per `COMPREHENSIVE_ARCHITECTURE.md`).  
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks (~180h, per `0_BUILD_PLAN_PHASE1_RUNWAY_DETAILED.md`).  
**Success Criteria**:  
- Client list loads in <2s for 50 clients (per `README.md`, `RowCol_Cash_Runway_Ritual.md`).  
- Advisor completes weekly ritual in <30 min/client (per `0_BUILD_PLAN_PHASE1_RUNWAY_DETAILED.md`).  
- Runway calculation accuracy â‰¥95% vs. QBO (per `README.md`).  
- 100% test coverage on core flows, zero critical vulnerabilities (per `PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md`).  
- Onboard new client in <5 min (per `0_BUILD_PLAN_PHASE1_RUNWAY_DETAILED.md`).

This plan is fully grounded in the documents and our conversation: advisor-first pivot from `README.md`, feature flags from `ADVISOR_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md`, smart features from `2_SMART_FEATURES_REFERENCE.md` and `1_BUILD_PLAN_PHASE2_SMART_TIER.md`, compliance/production from `PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md` and `build_plan_v5.md`, architecture from `COMPREHENSIVE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, ritual from `RowCol_Cash_Runway_Ritual.md`, and high-level roadmap from `BUILD_PLAN_ADVISOR_FIRST_RUNWAY.md` and `0_BUILD_PLAN_PHASE1_RUNWAY_DETAILED.md`. No TestDrive, robust QBO via `infra/qbo/`, Cursor-ready tasks. If anything is off, point it out, and I'll fix it immediately.

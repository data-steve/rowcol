## **üéØ MVP Alignment Strategy**

### **Phase 0.5: QBO-Only MVP (4-6 weeks)**
**Goal**: Use existing code with QBO-only gating

**Implementation**:
1. **Feature Gating**: Use existing `can_use_feature()` system
2. **Test Gating**: Gate multi-rail tests with feature flags
3. **Service Gating**: Gate multi-rail functionality in services
4. **UI Gating**: Show/hide multi-rail features in UI

**Code Changes**:
- Add feature flags for `ENABLE_RAMP_INTEGRATION`, `ENABLE_PLAID_INTEGRATION`, `ENABLE_STRIPE_INTEGRATION`
- Gate multi-rail functionality in existing services
- Create QBO-only golden dataset for testing
- Gate tests based on feature flags

### **Phase 1: Add Ramp (4-6 weeks)**
**Goal**: Extend existing code to include Ramp

**Implementation**:
1. **Enable Ramp**: Un-gate Ramp functionality
2. **Extend Services**: Add Ramp-specific logic to existing services
3. **Extend Tests**: Add Ramp integration tests
4. **Extend UI**: Show Ramp-specific features

## **üìä Effort Estimates**

- **UI Simplification**: 30h (combine digest + hygiene + console into dashboard)
- **Test Gating Strategy**: 15h (strategic test gating, not blanket silencing)
- **Total**: 115h (3-4 weeks)

### **Phase 1: Add Ramp (4-6 weeks)**
- **Ramp API Client**: 25h (build Ramp API client using BaseAPIClient)
- **Ramp Integration**: 30h (extend services to include Ramp functionality)

## **üöÄ Next Steps**

1. **Start with Core Services Audit** - understand what exists
2. **Identify Gating Points** - where to add feature flags
3. **Create QBO-Only Golden Dataset** - realistic test data
4. **Implement Feature Gating** - gate multi-rail functionality
5. **Test MVP Functionality** - ensure QBO-only works
6. **Plan Ramp Integration** - prepare for Phase 1

## **üí° Key Insights**

### **üéØ What You Have Built (Solid Foundation)**
- **Runway Calculator**: Pure, stateless, data-agnostic - perfect for MVP
- **Base API Client**: Comprehensive foundation for all integrations - ready to extend
- **Vendor Normalization**: Sophisticated system - ready for multi-rail
- **Core Services**: Digest, Hygiene, Console - need gating but solid logic
- **Infrastructure**: Job storage, smart sync, QBO config - ready for extension

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues to Address**
- **QBO Execution Assumptions**: Payment service assumes QBO can execute payments (it can't!)
- **Mixed Configurations**: QBO API settings buried in core_thresholds.py
- **Test Strategy**: Need principled gating, not blanket silencing

### **üöÄ Strategic Approach**
- **Phase 0.5**: QBO-only MVP using existing code with gating (115h)
- **Phase 1**: Add Ramp by extending existing services (110h)
- **Phase 2**: Add Plaid + Stripe using same patterns (125h)
- **Total**: 350h (9-12 weeks) vs 540h (13-14 weeks) for full build

### **üí™ Why This Works**
- **Preserves Investment**: 80% of existing code is reusable
- **Enables Learning**: QBO-only MVP lets you learn before expanding
- **Maintains Quality**: Principled gating vs random patching
- **Sets Up Success**: Each phase builds on the previous one

This approach gives you a working QBO-only MVP in 3-4 weeks while preserving your investment and setting up clean expansion to multi-rail.

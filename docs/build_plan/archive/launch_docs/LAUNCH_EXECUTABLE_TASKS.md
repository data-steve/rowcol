# Launch Executable Tasks - Reusable Recipe

*This file contains the standard instructions for executing fully-solved tasks hands-free*

## **Quick Start**

1. **Navigate to Project**: `cd ~/projects/oodaloo` (if not already there)
2. **Activate Environment**: `poetry shell` (one-time setup)
3. **Create Branch**: `git checkout -b cleanup/[task-name]`
4. **Start Application**: `uvicorn main:app --reload` (one-time, keep running in background)
5. **Execute Sequentially**: Work through tasks in order by their number
6. **Update Status**: Change `[ ]` to `[‚úÖ]` when complete
7. **Archive When Done**: Move completed task file to `archive/` when all tasks complete

## **CRITICAL: Read These Files First**

Before starting any executable tasks, you MUST read these files to understand the system:

### **Architecture Context:**
- `docs/architecture/COMPREHENSIVE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system architecture
- `docs/build_plan_v5.md` - Current build plan and phase context
- `docs/architecture/ADR-001-domains-runway-separation.md` - Domain separation principles
- `docs/architecture/ADR-005-qbo-api-strategy.md` - QBO integration strategy
- `docs/architecture/ADR-003-multi-tenancy-strategy.md` - Multi-tenancy patterns
- `DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` - Development standards and anti-patterns

### **Task-Specific Context:**
- Review the specific task document for additional context files
- Understand the current phase and architectural constraints
- Familiarize yourself with the codebase structure and patterns

## **Progress Tracking & Todo Management**

### **Task Status Tracking:**
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[üîÑ]` - In progress  
- `[‚úÖ]` - Completed
- `[‚ùå]` - Failed/Blocked

**IMPORTANT**: Always update the task status in the document as you work through tasks.

### **Cursor Todo Integration:**
1. **Create Cursor Todo** when starting a task
2. **Update Todo Status** as work progresses
3. **Add Cleanup Todos** for discovered edge cases
4. **Complete Todos** when work is done
5. **Clean Up Todos** when files are deleted

### **Status Mapping:**
- `[ ]` Not started ‚Üí Todo: "Not Started"
- `[üîÑ]` In progress ‚Üí Todo: "In Progress"
- `[‚úÖ]` Completed ‚Üí Todo: "Complete"
- `[‚ùå]` Failed/Blocked ‚Üí Todo: "Blocked"

## **How This Launch Doc Helps Task Docs Succeed**

### **Purpose of This Document:**
This launch doc provides the **context, patterns, and workflow** that executable task docs need to succeed. It's the "boilerplate" that makes task docs immediately actionable.

### **What Task Docs Provide:**
- **Specific files to fix** with exact changes needed
- **Implementation patterns** with code examples
- **Verification commands** to test success
- **Discovery commands** to find all occurrences

### **What This Launch Doc Provides:**
- **Architecture context** to understand the system
- **Workflow patterns** for consistent execution
- **Progress tracking** to manage multiple tasks
- **Common commands** for verification and cleanup
- **Git workflow** for proper version control

### **Together They Enable:**
- **Immediate execution** without additional context gathering
- **Consistent patterns** across all executable tasks
- **Proper progress tracking** and todo management
- **Clean, maintainable results** with proper cleanup

## **Execution Pattern**

### **For Each Task:**
1. **Read the task completely** - understand files to fix, patterns to implement
2. **CRITICAL: Validate Assumptions Against Reality** - don't assume task descriptions are accurate
3. **CRITICAL: Use Recursive Discovery/Triage Pattern** - understand what actually needs to be done
4. **Follow the implementation pattern** - use the provided code examples
5. **Run verification commands** - ensure changes work correctly
6. **Test with pytest** - run the specified test commands
7. **Update status in document** - change `[ ]` to `[‚úÖ]` in the task list
8. **Surgical git commit** - commit only the files modified for this task:
   ```bash
   git add [specific-files-modified]
   git commit -m "feat: [task-description] - [brief-summary]"
   ```

### **CRITICAL: Assumption Validation Before Execution**

**NEVER execute tasks without validating assumptions against reality.**

#### **Required Validation Steps:**
1. **Run Discovery Commands** - Find all occurrences of patterns mentioned in tasks
2. **Read Actual Code** - Don't assume task descriptions are accurate
3. **Compare Assumptions vs Reality** - Document mismatches
4. **Identify Architecture Gaps** - Understand current vs intended state
5. **Question Task Scope** - Are tasks solving the right problems?

#### **Discovery Documentation Template:**
```
### What Actually Exists:
- [List what you found that exists]

### What the Task Assumed:
- [List what the task assumed exists]

### Assumptions That Were Wrong:
- [List assumptions that don't match reality]

### Architecture Mismatches:
- [List where current implementation differs from intended architecture]

### Task Scope Issues:
- [List where tasks may be solving wrong problems or have unclear scope]
```

#### **Validation Process:**
1. **From a basic grep, search recursively outward** in that file until you understand what that code was intended to help with
2. **Then you will understand what the fix actually needs to be** beyond simplistic search and replace
3. **With that understanding you can compare it** to your understanding of broader task and ADRs, building plan etc
4. **Document mismatches** between task assumptions and code reality
5. **Plan fixes based on reality** not assumptions

### **CRITICAL: Recursive Discovery/Triage Pattern**

**NEVER do blind search-and-replace!** This pattern prevents costly mistakes:

1. **Search for all occurrences** of the pattern you need to fix
2. **Read the broader context** around each occurrence to understand what the method, service, route, or file is doing
3. **Triage each occurrence** - determine if it needs:
   - Simple replacement (exact match)
   - Contextual update (needs broader changes)
   - Complete overhaul (needs significant refactoring)
   - No change (false positive or already correct)
4. **Plan comprehensive updates** - ensure your fixes cover all cases and edge cases
5. **Handle dependencies** - update related imports, method calls, and references
6. **Verify the fix** - test that the change works in context

**Example Pattern:**
```bash
# Step 1: Find all occurrences
grep -r "get_.*_for_digest" . --include="*.py"

# Step 2: For each file found, read the broader context
# - What is this method doing?
# - What are the dependencies?
# - What needs to be updated beyond just the method name?

# Step 3: Plan comprehensive updates
# - Update method name
# - Update all calls to the method
# - Update imports if needed
# - Update related logic if needed

# Step 4: Implement with full context understanding
```

## **Comprehensive Cleanup (MANDATORY)**

### **After Each Task:**
1. **Remove Obsolete Files:** Delete any files that are no longer needed
2. **Clean Up Imports:** Remove unused imports, add missing imports
3. **Update References:** Fix all broken references and method calls
4. **Clean Up Tests:** Update test files that reference changed code
5. **Verify Cleanup:** Run verification commands to ensure no broken references

### **Cleanup Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Check for broken references
grep -r "old_pattern" . --include="*.py"
find . -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "obsolete_pattern" {} \;

# Check for unused imports
grep -r "import.*unused" . --include="*.py"

# Verify no broken references
pytest
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### **After All Tasks:**
1. **Archive task file** - move to `archive/` directory
2. **Merge branch** - `git checkout main && git merge cleanup/[task-name] && git branch -d cleanup/[task-name]`

## **Verification Strategy**

- **One-time startup**: `uvicorn main:app --reload` (keep running in background)
- **After EACH file change**: Check that uvicorn is still running (no restart needed)
- **After EACH task**: Run specified pytest commands
- **Before deleting ANY file**: `grep -r "filename" . --include="*.py"` to check references
- **Test user actions**: Verify they work immediately
- **Test background syncs**: Verify they use SmartSyncService correctly

## **Common Commands**

```bash
# Check for QBOBulkScheduledService usage
grep -r "QBOBulkScheduledService" domains/ar/services/ runway/routes/

# Check for QBODataService misuse
grep -r "QBODataService" runway/routes/ tests/

# Check for old infra imports
grep -r "from infra\.(cache|queue|scheduler)" . --include="*.py"

# Check for get_X_for_digest methods
grep -r "get_.*_for_digest" domains/

# Test application startup (one-time)
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Run tests
pytest
```

## **Git Workflow**

### **Surgical Commits (Per Task)**
```bash
# After completing each task, commit only the files you modified:
git add [file1.py] [file2.py] [file3.py]
git commit -m "feat: [task-name] - [brief-description-of-changes]"

# Example:
git add runway/experiences/tray.py qbo_sandbox_data_examples.md
git commit -m "feat: clean up tray.py - remove data providers, use SmartSyncService"
```

### **Final Merge (After All Tasks)**
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge your cleanup branch
git merge cleanup/[task-name]

# Delete the cleanup branch
git branch -d cleanup/[task-name]
```

## **Architecture Context**

### **Core System Patterns:**
- **Domain Services** (`domains/*/services/`): Business logic + CRUD operations
- **Runway Services** (`runway/`): Product orchestration and user experiences
- **Infrastructure Services** (`infra/`): Cross-cutting concerns (auth, database, external APIs)
- **Two-Layer Architecture**: `domains/` for business primitives, `runway/` for product features

### **Key Principles:**
- **Service Boundaries**: Clear separation between domain operations and product orchestration
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear purpose
- **Dependency Direction**: Runway depends on domains, not vice versa
- **Tenant Awareness**: All services filter by `business_id` for multi-tenancy

## **TASK LIST GOES HERE**

*Attach your specific executable task list to this file*

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Do NOT run multiple tasks simultaneously - they have dependencies and will collide!**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Use surgical git commits - only commit the files you actually modified for each task!**## **Working Relationship Guidelines**

### **Execution Phase Role**
- **Junior Dev Level**: Execute "solutioned" problems with clear implementation patterns
- **Self-Sufficient Analysis**: Answer questions through discovery before asking for help
- **Code Quality**: Write maintainable code for junior-mid level engineers with AI support

### **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
1. **Needless Questions**: Don't ask questions that can be answered through discovery or analysis
2. **Repeating Information**: Don't ask for information already provided in context
3. **Assumption-Based Questions**: Validate assumptions through discovery before asking

### **Effective Question Patterns**
- **Implementation Clarification**: "Should I use this pattern or the alternative approach?"
- **Scope Boundaries**: "Should I handle this edge case as part of this task?"
- **Verification**: "Does this implementation match the expected behavior?"

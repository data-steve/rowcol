# Oodaloo Agentic Positioning Strategy

**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Strategic Positioning Document  
**Purpose**: Align product, architecture, and messaging around "agentic cash flow console"

---

## **Core Strategic Insight**

**Oodaloo IS already an agentic system** - we just need to position it that way.

The OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) that Oodaloo is branded on **IS the agentic loop**:
- **Sense** (Observe): Pull AR/AP/balance data from QBO
- **Think** (Orient): Calculate runway, prioritize decisions, simulate scenarios
- **Act** (Decide): Stage Must Pay/Can Delay, queue actions
- **Review** (Act): Human approval → execute to QBO

**This is agentic commerce for cash flow management.**

## **What Makes Oodaloo Agentic**

### **1. Intelligent Prep Tray (Pre-Processing Agent)**
- Automatically identifies hygiene issues
- Flags missing data, unmatched transactions
- Tees up what's broken, ready, or blocked
- **Agent behavior**: Sense and classify

### **2. Cash Console (Reasoning Surface)**
- Calculates runway impact for each decision
- Sequences decisions by priority order
- Simulates "pay vs delay" scenarios
- **Agent behavior**: Think and optimize

### **3. Approve → Execute (Action Policy)**
- One human approval translates to multiple QBO actions
- Batches payments, reminders, reserve allocations
- Executes with QBO-native rails
- **Agent behavior**: Act under human governance

### **4. Drift Alerts (Feedback Loop)**
- Monitors reality vs plan
- Flags deviations and proposes corrections
- Maintains audit trail
- **Agent behavior**: Learn and adapt

### **Market Positioning**

**vs QuickBooks**:
- QBO: Journal-first, compliance-driven, task-focused

## **The Bottom Line**

**Oodaloo is ALREADY an agentic system** - we just need to:

1. **Call it what it is**: "Agentic cash flow console"
2. **Embrace the positioning**: AI-native, not AI-enhanced
3. **Differentiate from QBO**: Orchestration vs task automation
4. **Build agentic features**: Smart Policies make AI obvious
5. **Scale to RowCol**: Multi-client agentic console

**The OODA loop IS the agentic loop** - we're just making it explicit and building the intelligence layer that makes it feel truly agentic with Smart Policies and adaptive learning.

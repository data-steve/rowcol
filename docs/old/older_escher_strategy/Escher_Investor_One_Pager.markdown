# Escher: Revolutionizing Accounting Firm Scalability

## The Opportunity
Escher is a white-label bookkeeping and monthly close service poised to capture the $20B+ U.S. accounting services market. By delivering audit-ready financials and controller-level insights for accounting firms, Escher enables firms to scale client capacity without adding staff, achieving D+5 closes with unmatched quality. Our proprietary platform, powered by a robust rules-based engine, drives 70-80% process efficiency, ensuring high-margin operations (50-70%) and positioning Escher for acquisition by platforms like RowCol/CloudFirms or expansion into SaaS licensing.

## Why Escher Stands Out
- **Market Fit**: Targets small-to-mid-size accounting firms (80% of U.S. market) struggling to scale bookkeeping and Client Accounting Services (CAS) due to labor intensity.
- **Premium Service**: Combines expert coordinators with a tech platform to deliver clean books, audit-ready binders, and insights (e.g., AR creep, margin compression) under firm branding.
- **Scalable Tech**: Multi-tenant platform integrates with QuickBooks Online (QBO) via webhooks/CDC, with extensibility to Xero/NetSuite. Handles AP, AR, bank/CC, inventory, payroll, and close workflows.
- **High Margins**: Tiered pricing ($500-$2000+/mo) delivers 50-70% margins; onboarding fees (1.5x-2x monthly) and add-ons (e.g., year-end prep, reporting) boost revenue.
- **Exit Potential**: Scalable service model and tech stack make Escher a prime acquisition target or SaaS licensing opportunity.

## How It Works
1. **Seamless Onboarding**: Firms onboard clients; Escher connects to QBO, Plaid, BILL/Melio, and Gusto for data sync.
2. **Expert Coordination + Tech**: Coordinators manage exceptions, while our platform automates 70-80% of transaction categorization, reconciliations, and binder assembly. Webhooks and CDC ensure real-time data accuracy.
3. **Premium Deliverables**:
   - **Close Readiness Score**: Tracks % reconciled, exceptions, and missing documents for transparency.
   - **Evidence Locker**: Links every GL entry to source documents for auditability.
   - **Close Binder**: Audit-ready Excel/PDF with cover, tickmark legend, BS/IS, JEs, AP/AR snapshots, and close summary narrative.
   - **Advisory Insights**: Surfaces trends (e.g., 10% AR creep) for firms to resell as advisory services.
4. **Scalable Execution**: Multi-tenant design and task orchestration support 10-50 clients per firm, with KPIs (automation rate, error rate, client satisfaction) for continuous improvement.

## Competitive Edge
Unlike competitors like Keeper (manual-heavy), Docyt (self-service), or QBO Live ($300-$700/mo, limited automation), Escher offers:
- **Deep Automation with Quality**: 70-80% process efficiency with self-improving rules, ensuring <5 review notes per binder.
- **White-Label Branding**: Strengthens firm-client relationships, unlike QBO Live’s Intuit branding.
- **Advisory Enablement**: Controller-level insights (e.g., margin compression) without CPA licensing, unlike Karbon or Financial Cents.
- **Scalability**: Multi-firm, multi-client orchestration vs. QBO’s single-client focus.

## Traction Plan
- **Pilot Phase**: Engage 1-2 firms (3-5 clients) in Q4 2025 to validate workflows using QBO sandbox or real clients. Measure automation penetration, time-to-close, and review hours saved.
- **Market Outreach**: Target 20+ firms via LinkedIn Sales Navigator, CPA directories, and AccountingToday Top 100. Deliver competitive teardown (Keeper, ClientHub) to refine positioning.
- **Revenue Model**: $500-$2000+/mo per client, with $750-$4000 onboarding fees. Add-ons (PBC chasing, year-end prep) drive 20-40% revenue uplift.
- **Team**: 1 SWE, 0.5 data SWE, 0.5 ops/bookkeeper for MVP (~137h, 2-3 months); full build (~247h, 4-5 months).

## Investment Ask
- **Seed Round**: $500K to fund MVP (Stages 0, 1A, 1C, 2), pilot execution, and initial firm partnerships.
- **Use of Funds**: 60% tech development (FastAPI, Postgres, React), 20% pilot operations, 20% market outreach and competitive analysis.
- **Exit Strategy**: Acquisition by accounting platforms (e.g., RowCol) or transition to SaaS licensing within 3-5 years.

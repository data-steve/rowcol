# QBO API Integration Validation Plan
## Risk Assessment & Validation Strategy

**Date**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All validation infrastructure implemented and documented  
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Core product functionality depends on these assumptions  

---

## Executive Summary

We've identified **significant integration risk** in our current QBO implementation. While we've mocked extensively for development speed, we need to validate our core assumptions before building more capabilities that could fail in production.

### Current State Analysis
- **70% of our core features depend on QBO API access**
- **Mock implementation covers ~90% of current functionality**  
- **Zero real QBO sandbox validation of critical data flows**
- **Integration assumptions based on documentation review only**

## Validation Plan: 3-Phase Approach

### **Phase A: Sandbox Environment Setup (4h)**

#### **A1: QBO Developer Account & Sandbox Setup** (2h)
```bash
# Tasks:
1. Create QBO Developer account (if not exists)
2. Set up Sandbox Company with realistic agency data
3. Configure OAuth 2.0 application credentials
4. Test basic authentication flow
```

#### **A2: Test Data Creation** (2h)
```python
# Create realistic agency test data in QBO Sandbox:
SAMPLE_DATA = {
    "vendors": [
        {"name": "Office Landlord", "payment_terms": "Net 30"},
        {"name": "Software Subscriptions", "payment_terms": "Net 15"},
        {"name": "Marketing Agency", "payment_terms": "Net 45"}
    ],
    "customers": [
        {"name": "Client A - Tech Startup", "payment_terms": "Net 30"},
        {"name": "Client B - E-commerce", "payment_terms": "Net 45"},
        {"name": "Client C - SaaS Company", "payment_terms": "Net 15"}
    ],
    "bills": [
        {"vendor": "Office Landlord", "amount": 5000, "due_date": "+7d"},
        {"vendor": "Software", "amount": 1200, "due_date": "+3d"},
        {"vendor": "Marketing", "amount": 3500, "due_date": "+14d"}
    ],
    "invoices": [
        {"customer": "Client A", "amount": 8000, "due_date": "-5d"},  # Overdue
        {"customer": "Client B", "amount": 12000, "due_date": "+10d"},
        {"customer": "Client C", "amount": 6000, "due_date": "-15d"}  # Very overdue
    ]
}
```

### **Phase B: Core API Validation (8h)**

#### **B1: Authentication & Basic Access** (2h)
```python
# Test OAuth flow and basic API access
def test_qbo_auth():
    # Real OAuth 2.0 flow
    auth_url = get_authorization_url()
    # Manual authorization step
    tokens = exchange_code_for_tokens(auth_code)
    # Token refresh validation
    refreshed_tokens = refresh_access_token(refresh_token)
    assert tokens["access_token"] is not None
```

#### **B2: Bills API Deep Validation** (3h)
```python
# Critical for Smart AP functionality
def test_bills_api_comprehensive():
    # Read bills with all fields we need
    bills = qbo_client.query("SELECT * FROM Bill WHERE Active = true")
    
    # Validate required fields exist
    for bill in bills:
        assert "Id" in bill
        assert "VendorRef" in bill
        assert "TotalAmt" in bill
        assert "DueDate" in bill
        assert "Balance" in bill
        
    # Test bill modification (critical for payment scheduling)
    bill_id = bills[0]["Id"]
    updated_bill = qbo_client.update_bill(bill_id, {"DueDate": "2023-11-01"})
    assert updated_bill["DueDate"] == "2023-11-01"
    
    # Test payment terms access
    vendor_id = bills[0]["VendorRef"]["value"]
    vendor = qbo_client.get_vendor(vendor_id)
    # Verify we can get payment terms for timing optimization
```

#### **B3: Invoices API Deep Validation** (2h)
```python
# Critical for Smart AR functionality
def test_invoices_api_comprehensive():
    # Read invoices with aging information
    invoices = qbo_client.query("SELECT * FROM Invoice WHERE Active = true")
    
    # Validate aging calculations
    for invoice in invoices:
        due_date = datetime.fromisoformat(invoice["DueDate"])
        aging_days = (datetime.now() - due_date).days
        assert aging_days >= 0  # Can calculate aging
        
    # Test payment matching capabilities
    payments = qbo_client.query("SELECT * FROM Payment WHERE Active = true")
    # Verify we can match payments to invoices
```

#### **B4: Account Balances Validation** (1h)
```python
# Critical for runway calculations
def test_accounts_api():
    # Get all bank accounts
    accounts = qbo_client.query("SELECT * FROM Account WHERE AccountType = 'Bank'")
    
    # Validate balance data structure
    for account in accounts:
        assert "CurrentBalance" in account
        assert "AccountType" in account
        assert account["Active"] == True
        
    # Test real-time balance accuracy
    balance_sum = sum(acc["CurrentBalance"] for acc in accounts)
    assert balance_sum > 0  # Sanity check
```

### **Phase C: Integration Flow Testing (6h)**

#### **C1: End-to-End Runway Calculation** (2h)
```python
# Test the complete runway calculation flow
def test_runway_calculation_e2e():
    # Get real data from QBO
    bills = get_bills_due_within_days(30)
    invoices = get_overdue_invoices()
    balances = get_account_balances()
    
    # Calculate runway using real data
    runway_days = calculate_runway(bills, invoices, balances)
    
    # Validate calculation makes sense
    assert runway_days > 0
    assert runway_days < 365  # Sanity check
    
    # Test with modified data
    delayed_bills = delay_bills(bills, days=7)
    new_runway = calculate_runway(delayed_bills, invoices, balances)
    assert new_runway > runway_days  # Delaying bills should increase runway
```

#### **C2: Smart AP Flow Validation** (2h)
```python
# Test payment timing optimization
def test_smart_ap_flow():
    # Get bills with payment terms
    bills = get_bills_with_payment_terms()
    
    # Calculate latest safe pay dates
    for bill in bills:
        latest_safe = calculate_latest_safe_pay_date(bill)
        assert latest_safe >= bill["DueDate"]
        
        # Test runway impact calculation
        runway_impact = calculate_runway_impact_of_delay(bill, latest_safe)
        assert runway_impact >= 0
```

#### **C3: Smart AR Flow Validation** (2h)
```python
# Test collections prioritization
def test_smart_ar_flow():
    # Get overdue invoices
    overdue = get_overdue_invoices()
    
    # Test priority scoring
    for invoice in overdue:
        priority_score = calculate_collection_priority(invoice)
        assert 0 <= priority_score <= 100
        
        # Test customer payment history
        customer_history = get_customer_payment_history(invoice["CustomerRef"]["value"])
        reliability_score = calculate_payment_reliability(customer_history)
        assert 0 <= reliability_score <= 1
```

## Risk Mitigation Plan

### **High-Risk Scenarios & Contingencies**

#### **Risk 1: QBO Bills API Limitations**
**Scenario**: Cannot modify due dates or payment terms as assumed
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement read-only mode with external scheduling
- Use QBO notes fields for payment scheduling metadata
- Build internal payment intent system

#### **Risk 2: QBO Rate Limiting Issues**
**Scenario**: API rate limits prevent real-time runway calculations
**Mitigation**:
- Implement smart caching layer (already built)
- Batch API calls during off-peak hours
- Use webhooks for real-time updates instead of polling

#### **Risk 3: QBO Payment Processing Limitations**
**Scenario**: Cannot execute payments through QBO API
**Mitigation**:
- Partner with QBO Payments or third-party ACH provider
- Build payment intent system with manual execution
- Focus on payment optimization rather than execution

#### **Risk 4: Data Quality Issues**
**Scenario**: QBO data is incomplete or inconsistent
**Mitigation**:
- Implement data validation and cleansing
- Build hygiene scoring (already implemented)
- Provide data quality improvement recommendations

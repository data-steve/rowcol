# RowCol — The Cash Runway Ritual for Advisors

**Who it's for:**

CAS advisors and vCFO professionals managing 20-50 client businesses (service-based agencies, consultancies, professional services firms with $1-5M revenue, 10-30 staff) using QuickBooks Online.

**Why advisors need it:**

* Cash flow swings weekly across your client portfolio: clients pay late, bills bunch up, payroll looms
* You spend hours every week in spreadsheets for each client just to decide what to pay or chase
* Your clients trust you to keep them out of cash crunches, but manual tracking doesn't scale past 20-30 clients

---

## The Insight

**The Ritual**

Every week or two, you sit down with each client's books to answer three questions:

1. Can this client cover upcoming payroll and essential bills?
2. Which overdue invoices need chasing?
3. Which vendors must they pay now, and which can wait?

The ones who don't ask these questions end up asking harder ones later: *Why did we overcommit? Why can't we make payroll? How did cash disappear when sales look fine?*

It's no surprise: **82% of small business failures are tied to cash flow issues** (U.S. Bank). **Two-thirds of SMBs say late payments hurt their business** (Intuit, *State of Small Business Cash Flow*), and **over half lose $10k+ a year** from timing mismatches.

For advisors who run this ritual, the frustration is the same: hours lost in spreadsheets, scattered QBO reports, and judgment calls with no clear picture across your entire client portfolio.

**Isn't there a better way to get weekly runway clarity across all your clients?**

---

**The Gap**

The problem is you manage multiple clients across different tools, while each client's data lives in QuickBooks Online. Even though data flows into QBO, there's still a gap between "where the data lives" and "where you make decisions."

```
[Your Client] Ops (Asana/ServiceTitan) → [QBO] Books → [You] Advisory Decisions
                                              ↓
                                    [You need] Multi-Client Runway Dashboard
                                          (Spreadsheets today)
```

You need to bridge this gap across 20-50 clients simultaneously, not one at a time.

---

**The Opportunity**

The cash runway ritual bridges that gap. It's not bookkeeping, and it's not tax prep—it connects your clients' operations to their financial reality at the point of maximum relevance. It's the operating layer where you actually decide what gets paid and chased.

Is this QuickBooks by another name? Here's the key difference: **QBO is journal-first (proper bookkeeping), but RowCol is runway-first (will payroll clear Friday?)**

When cash is thin, even the so-called "edge cases" matter. That's when software should unify the moving parts into one clear picture—how your clients need to run, not just how the books get recorded.

Yet no tool supports this ritual end-to-end across multiple clients. On the financial side, AR tools collect, AP tools pay, forecasting apps model, and QBO holds the ledger. But none bring **cash-in, cash-out, and cash-on-hand** together in one place where you can manage your entire client portfolio.

**RowCol productizes that missing advisory layer.**

The ritual is the perfect candidate for software:
* Scalable enough for you to serve 20-50 clients with batch workflows
* Structured enough to elevate your advisory services
* Light enough for weekly execution without complex setup

## RowCol — Your Multi-Client Cash Flow Console

**Why "RowCol"?** From the OODA loop: *observe, orient, decide, act—rinse and repeat.* The same pattern modern advisors use, now in software.

**Positioning**: Multi-client cash flow console for CAS advisors. Not a chatbot or autopilot—an intelligent system that stages decisions across your client portfolio, you approve and execute.

RowCol automates the weekly cash runway ritual across your 20-50 clients:

* **Friday Client Overview (Observe):** See all clients at a glance—runway days, who's at risk, what needs attention
* **3-Tab Client View (Orient):** Drill into any client: Digest (runway summary), Hygiene (data quality), Console (decisions to make)
* **Batch Decisions (Decide/Act):** Approve bills, trigger collections, earmark payments—actions sync to QBO automatically
* **Variance Alerts (Learn):** Get notified when client runway drops unexpectedly, so you can act proactively

**The Win:** Get back 10-20 hours a week across your client portfolio, avoid the 20-30% runway misses that sink agencies, while maintaining full trust through your expert oversight.

## Why Now

**QBO is getting smarter** (AI-powered transaction categorization, automated reconciliation). That's great—it means cleaner data for your runway calculations.

But QBO will always be journal-first (bookkeeping compliance). **RowCol is runway-first (client survival).**

As bookkeeping becomes more automated, **your value shifts to advisory**. RowCol positions you as the strategic advisor who keeps clients out of cash crunches, not just the bookkeeper who categorizes transactions.

**The weekly runway ritual is your competitive moat.**

## Questions?

**"Can I try it with just a few clients first?"**
Yes! Start with Tier 1 for 5-10 clients at $50/month each. Prove the ritual works, then expand.

**"Does this replace QuickBooks?"**
No—RowCol sits on top of QBO. We pull data from QBO (bills, invoices, bank balances), calculate runway, and sync decisions back to QBO (approve bills, schedule payments).

**"What if my clients have complex multi-entity structures?"**
Tier 1-2 handles single-entity clients. Tier 3-4 adds multi-entity consolidation and advanced reporting.

**"Can I white-label this for my clients?"**
Yes—Tier 4 includes white-label branding, custom domains, and branded client reports.

**"What about data security?"**
Bank-level encryption, SOC 2 compliance roadmap, role-based access control. Your clients' data is safe.

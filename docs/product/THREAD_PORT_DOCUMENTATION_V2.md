# Thread Port Documentation V2: RowCol Build Plan Finalization

**Date**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Complete context transfer for AI assistant continuity across Cursor sessions  
**Status**: CRITICAL - This document contains essential context for continuing development

---

## üéØ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This document captures the completion of RowCol's strategic build planning phase. We've successfully created comprehensive, execution-ready build plans and feature catalogs that can be used with Cursor's "Auto" mode for development. The next phase is technical debt assessment and codebase gap analysis to bridge the idealized plans with current reality.

**Key Outcome**: We have detailed, phase-based build plans for RowCol's advisor-first platform, with clear task breakdowns and execution guidance. The next phase requires honest assessment of current codebase state vs. build plan requirements.

---

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Next Thread)**

### **Phase 0: Reality Check (Next 1-2 days)**
1. **Codebase Gap Analysis**
   - Audit existing `runway/` services against Phase 1 requirements
   - Identify what's already built vs. what needs building
   - Map current file structure to build plan tasks

2. **Technical Debt Assessment**
   - Identify P0 blockers (QBO mocking, real data integration)
   - Catalog P1 improvements (auth context, multi-tenancy)
   - Prioritize what must be fixed before Phase 1

3. **Next 20 Hours Plan**
   - Create specific, executable tasks with exact file paths
   - Bridge the gap between idealized plans and current reality
   - Focus on immediate wins that unblock Phase 1

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Next 2-3 weeks)**
1. **Database Migration**: `firm_id` ‚Üí `advisor_id` throughout codebase
2. **Create `advisor/` Layer**: New architectural layer for advisor-client interaction
3. **Feature Gating System**: Implement subscription tier-based feature flags
4. **Console Payment Workflow**: Implement advisor-only payment decision workflow

### **Phase 2: Core Features (Next 4-6 weeks)**
1. **Client List View**: Show all clients with key metrics
2. **3-Tab Client View**: Digest + Hygiene Tray + Decision Console
3. **Batch Decision Making**: Pay bills, send collections
4. **Smart Features**: Earmarking, collections, automation (Tier 2)

## üö® **CRITICAL WARNINGS**

### **DO NOT**
- Start building without codebase gap analysis
- Ignore technical debt blockers
- Assume current codebase matches build plans
- Skip the reality check phase

### **ALWAYS**
- Audit existing code before building new features
- Address P0 technical debt before Phase 1
- Create specific, executable tasks with file paths
- Bridge idealized plans with current reality

---

## üîÑ **CONTINUITY CHECKLIST**

When starting work in the next thread:

1. **Read Build Plans**: Start with `docs/product/new_plan/SMART_FEATURES_REFERENCE.md`
2. **Audit Codebase**: Compare existing code to Phase 1 requirements
3. **Assess Technical Debt**: Identify P0 blockers and P1 improvements
4. **Create Gap Analysis**: Document what exists vs. what's needed
5. **Plan Next 20 Hours**: Specific, executable tasks with exact file paths
6. **Start Phase 1**: Begin with foundation tasks (database migration, advisor layer)

## üìû **CONTACT & CONTEXT**

**Original Thread**: This documentation was created from comprehensive build plan finalization  
**Key Decisions**: All build plans, feature tiers, and execution frameworks are documented  
**Implementation Status**: Build plans complete, ready for codebase gap analysis  
**Next Phase**: Technical debt assessment and reality check before Phase 1 implementation  

**Remember**: The build plans are idealized. Before execution, we need honest assessment of current codebase state vs. build plan requirements. Technical debt must be addressed before net-new feature building.

*This document serves as the complete context transfer for continuing development of the RowCol advisor platform. All build plans, feature catalogs, and execution frameworks are documented here. The next phase requires codebase gap analysis and technical debt assessment.*

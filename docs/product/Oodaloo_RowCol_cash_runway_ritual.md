# Oodaloo / RowCol — The Cash Runway Ritual

**Who it's for:**

* **PRIMARY**: CAS firms managing 20-100 client businesses (creative/marketing/IT, \$1–5M revenue, 10–30 staff) on QBO.
* **FUTURE**: Individual business owners (Phase 7+ via QBO App Store).

**Why CAS firms need it:**

* Cash flow swings weekly across their client portfolio: clients pay late, bills bunch up, payroll looms.
* CAS firms spend hours every week managing spreadsheets for each client just to decide what to pay or chase.
* **Data completeness challenge**: Individual owners won't maintain missing bills/data, but CAS firms will ensure quality.

## The Insight

**The Ritual**
Every week or two, CAS firm staff (and their client business owners) sit down to answer three questions across their client portfolio:

1. Which clients can cover upcoming payroll and core bills?
2. Which clients have late AR that need chasing?
3. Which vendors must each client pay now, and which can wait?

**Firm-first context**: CAS firms run this ritual for 20-100 clients simultaneously, identifying which clients are at runway risk and need immediate attention.

The ones who don't ask these questions end up asking harder ones later: *Why did we overcommit? Why can't I make payroll? How did cash disappear when sales look fine?*

It’s no surprise: **82% of small business failures are tied to cash flow issues** (U.S. Bank). **Two-thirds of SMBs say late payments hurt their business** (Intuit, *State of Small Business Cash Flow*), and **over half lose \$10k+ a year** from timing mismatches (CPA.com / Intuit surveys).

For those who *do* run the ritual, the frustration is the same: hours lost in spreadsheets, scattered reports, and judgment calls with no clear picture. Either way, the question persists: **isn’t there a better way to get weekly runway clarity?**

**The Gulf**
The problem is **CAS firms manage multiple clients across different ops tools, while each client's bookkeeper lives in QBO, where compliance happens.** Even though data flows into QBO, in practice there's still a gulf between those two worlds for each client.

```
[Client] Ops (Asana/ServiceTitan) ----> [Client Bookkeeper] Books (QBO) ----> [CPA] Taxes (UltraTax)
                                            /
                                           /
                           [CAS Firm] Multi-Client Runway (Spreadsheets today, RowCol tomorrow)
```

**Firm-first context**: CAS firms need to bridge this gulf across 20-100 clients simultaneously, not just one business.

---

**The Opportunity**
The cash runway ritual bridges that gulf. It's not ops, and it's not compliance—it connects each client's operations to their financial reality at the point of maximum relevance. It's the missing operating layer where CAS firms and their clients actually decide what gets paid and chased.

Is this QuickBooks by another name? Here's the key orientation: **QBO is journal-first, but RowCol is runway-first.** QBO cares that every credit and debit is properly booked; RowCol cares whether each client's payroll clears Friday.

When cash is thin, even the so-called "edge cases" matter. That's when software should unify the moving parts into one clear picture — how each business needs to run, not just how the books get recorded.

Yet no tool supports this ritual end-to-end across multiple clients. On the financial side, AR tools collect, AP tools pay, forecasting apps model, and QBO holds the ledger. But none bring **cash-in, cash-out, and cash-on-hand** together in one place where CAS firms can manage their entire client portfolio.

**RowCol productizes that missing multi-client financial-ops layer.**

The ritual is the perfect candidate for software:

* **PRIMARY**: Scalable enough for CAS firms to serve 20-100 clients with batch workflows
* **FUTURE**: Light enough for individual owners to self-serve (Phase 7+)
* Structured enough for firm staff to uplevel client advisory services

## RowCol — The Multi-Client Cash Flow Console

**Why "RowCol"?** From the OODA loop: *observe, orient, decide, act—rinse and repeat.* The same pattern modern AI agents use, scaled for CAS firms.

**Positioning**: Multi-client cash flow console for CAS firms. Not a chatbot or autopilot—an intelligent system that stages decisions across your client portfolio, you approve and execute.

For our primary ICP (CAS firms), RowCol automates the weekly cash runway ritual across 20-100 clients through intelligent orchestration:

* **Multi-Client Friday Digest (Observe):** Batch overview across all clients showing runway risk, late AR, AP due, and data quality issues.
* **Multi-Client Cash Console (Orient):** Batch view grouping bills into *Must Pay* vs *Can Delay* by runway impact, prioritizing AR collections across clients.
* **Batch Approve → Execute (Decide/Act):** One firm approval triggers batch QBO actions across multiple clients—reminders, payments, reserves.
* **Client Drift Alerts (Learn):** Monitors reality vs plan across client portfolio, flags deviations, proposes corrections.

**The Win:** 80% automation with 100% control—CAS firms get back 20-40 hours a week across their client portfolio, avoid the 20–30% runway misses that sink agencies, while maintaining full trust through human-in-the-loop approval.

**Firm-First Differentiation**: QBO agents handle task automation (categorize, reconcile). RowCol handles multi-client decision orchestration (compress, prioritize, optimize across portfolio).

### Planned Modules (Firm-First Feature Evolution)

* **Core Multi-Client Ritual (Foundation):** Batch Weekly Digest, Multi-Client Console, Data Quality Score, Client Prep Tray, Portfolio Runway metrics—scaled for CAS firm workflows.
* **Data Completeness (P0 Critical):** Bank feed integration, missing bill detection, POS integration—ensures reliable runway calculations across client portfolio.
* **Smart AP (Client Rules):** Per-client earmarking, timeline conditional releases, vendor credit handling—learns payment preferences per client and auto-stages decisions.
* **Smart AR (Client Collections):** Per-client priorities, custom reminder drips, auto-pause on payment, match/clean deposits—optimizes collection timing by customer behavior per client.
* **Smart Budgets (Client Constraints):** Per-client guardrails for essential vs discretionary spend, vacation pre-planning, policy engine—enforces spending rules and learns from deviations per client.
* **Analytics Pack (Portfolio Insights):** Cross-client AR/AP aging trends, profit analysis, 2–4 week forecasts, shareable dashboards, benchmarking—predicts scenarios and recommends optimizations across portfolio.

RowCol is modular by design. Not every client has complex AR or AP needs that justify tools like Ramp, but every CAS firm needs the weekly cash runway ritual across their portfolio. Smaller CAS-only shops can use RowCol as their core operating console; larger firms can layer it on top of existing rails, using Multi-Client Ritual + Analytics as the shared judgment surface even when AP/AR execution happens elsewhere.

### Distribution Plan

**Phase 1: Direct Sales to CAS Firms (RowCol)**
RowCol is the firm-first wedge:

* CAS firms managing 20-100 clients can adopt it directly through direct sales.
* Higher expectations: multi-client batch workflows, data completeness, RBAC.
* Each firm proves the model and builds design partners.

**Phase 2: QBO Marketplace (Oodaloo) - Future**
Once proven with CAS firms, individual owners can access via QBO App Store:

* **RowCol Runway:** Batch weekly reviews, data quality scoring, role-based access, audit trails.
* **RowCol Compliance Assist (future):** HITL transaction categorization & vendor normalization.
* **RowCol Close (future):** Monthly close workflows/checklists, fed by RowCol's data exhaust.

**Note:** Keeper today is the best-known CAS-side tool, but it is compliance-first. As QBO’s new UI-triggered Agents automate bookkeeping hygiene, Keeper’s core gets squeezed. Firms will want to offer more defensible, client-facing services — and the weekly cash runway ritual is the obvious choice.

---

### Why Oodaloo / RowCol

**Why it works:** The weekly cash call is already viewed as controller-level, high-leverage work. Until now, only businesses with access to internal finance/external CAS teams had the capacity to do it consistently.

RowCol productizes the ritual on top of QBO rails for CAS firms:

* **Direct Sales to CAS Firms:** high-intent buyers managing 20-100 clients, needing weekly proof of value.
* **CAS firms:** fastest-growing service line, needing multi-client batch workflows.
* **Firm Staff:** willing to pay more for judgment-driven tools than dashboards—because this ties directly to client payroll and peace of mind.

At the nexus of cash-in, cash-out, and cash-on-hand, RowCol stands where CAS firms and their clients meet every week. That makes it indispensable—and gives it pricing power—while incumbents remain focused on tax and compliance.

**Why now (and why it's durable):** Even as QBO adds agents and automation for bookkeeping hygiene, those features **strengthen the inputs.** RowCol focuses on the **judgment moment**—compressing AR/AP timing and runway into a single **firm approval that executes across multiple clients.** 

**Firm-first positioning is defensible**: QBO agents handle task-level automation (journal-first, compliance-driven). RowCol's multi-client console handles decision-level orchestration (runway-first, survival-driven). These are complementary layers, not competing products. QBO agents clean the pipes; RowCol decides what flows through across the client portfolio.

CAS firms benefit as low-value categorization is automated by QBO agents; RowCol elevates their weekly advisory with multi-client decision orchestration and feeds a cleaner month-end close.

### Questions / Risks

* **Adoption & behavior change:** Will CAS firms adopt multi-client workflows, or will usage skew toward individual client management?
* **Buyer clarity:** Who is the long-term buyer — the CAS firm, the individual client, or both?
* **Distribution reality:** Does direct sales to CAS firms drive real adoption, or is QBO Marketplace the true growth engine?
* **Durability of the ritual:** Is the weekly runway ritual powerful enough — with multi-client AP/AR, budgeting, and analytics — to anchor an enduring app, or will firms still see it as "just another tool"?
* **Data completeness:** Can CAS firms ensure data quality across 20-100 clients, or will missing bills/data break the runway calculations?

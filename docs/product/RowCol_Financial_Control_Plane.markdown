# RowCol — The Financial Control Plane for CAS 2.0 Firms

*Version 3.4 — Cash Discipline for Multi-Client Portfolios*

**Positioning**: A Financial Control Plane for CAS 2.0 firms, governing multi-client cash flow with advisor-grade trust through a streamlined verification loop.

**Promise**: Approve once, verify outcomes, and prove cash discipline across 20–100 clients—without spreadsheets.

**Tagline**: *Govern cash, at firm scale.*

## What is RowCol?

RowCol productizes **cash discipline** as a **Financial Control Plane**, orchestrating the multi-rail stack that CAS 2.0 firms have already adopted: QuickBooks Online (ledger), Ramp (A/P execution), Plaid (cash verification), and Stripe (A/R insights). Unlike passive dashboards or single-client tools, it enables advisors to:

- **Govern**: Approve payments with liquidity guardrails (e.g., 14-day buffer).
- **Verify**: Confirm execution and sync outcomes across rails.
- **Prove**: Deliver branded digests to justify client retainers.

**The Win**: Save 30+ minutes/client/week, govern 50%+ of bills via RowCol, eliminate spreadsheets by week 3, and strengthen client trust with proactive deliverables.

**Key Insight**: RowCol isn't selling a new workflow—it's automating the multi-rail orchestration that CAS 2.0 firms were forced to build manually. Each rail has a specific role in a hub-and-spoke architecture: **QBO (hub)** provides the ledger truth, **Ramp (spoke)** handles execution, **Plaid (spoke)** verifies cash, **Stripe (spoke)** informs A/R. RowCol is the Financial Control Plane that orchestrates these rails, making multi-client cash discipline feel simple and powerful.

## Why CAS 2.0 Needs a Control Plane

CAS 2.0 firms—advisors managing 20–100 SMB clients ($1-5M revenue, 10-30 staff)—face unique challenges in scaling strategic advisory:

- **Siloed Rails**: QBO (ledger), Ramp (A/P), Plaid (cash), and Stripe (A/R) require manual spreadsheet aggregation, unscalable past 20-30 clients.
- **Time Drain**: Weekly “Friday cash checks” take 30–45 minutes/client, limiting advisory capacity.
- **Cash Flow Risks**: 82% of SMB failures stem from cash flow issues (U.S. Bank); advisors must prevent payroll misses and crunches.
- **Client Trust**: Advisors need branded deliverables to prove proactive governance and justify $5k-$10k/month retainers.

**Market Validation**: Mid-market firms using all-in-one finance tools save hours weekly on cash discipline, proving demand for governance over visibility. No tool offers multi-client cash supervision, leaving CAS 2.0 firms stuck with fragmented workflows.

**RowCol's Edge**: Unifies siloed rails into a multi-client Financial Control Plane using hub-and-spoke architecture, enabling scalable advisory with audit-proof outcomes. RowCol orchestrates, rails execute—making complexity feel simple.

### What's New with CAS 2.0?

Over the past 5+ years, new technology stacks and client demands have pushed accounting firms toward CAS 2.0, where standardized, automated workflows deliver strategic advisory alongside operations. Unlike traditional bookkeeping or CAS 1.0, CAS 2.0 firms bundle weekly cash governance with A/P, A/R, and KPIs to drive client value.

| Attribute | Bookkeeping (Traditional) | CAS 1.0 (2010s) | CAS 2.0 (Modern) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Data entry, reconciliations | Bookkeeping, bill pay, payroll | Bookkeeping, A/P, A/R, weekly advisory |
| **Tech Stack** | QBO, manual processes | QBO, Bill.com, Gusto | QBO, Ramp/Relay, Plaid, Stripe |
| **Workflow** | Client-specific, manual | Semi-standardized | Standardized, automated |
| **Touchpoints** | Month-end, year-end | Monthly reports | Weekly cash checks, monthly KPIs |
| **Value Proposition** | Compliance | Outsourced back office | Strategic advisory + operations |
| **Staff Roles** | Bookkeepers | Bookkeepers, clerks | Bookkeepers, controllers, advisors |

## How RowCol Works: MVP ($50/client/month)

RowCol’s **verification loop** (Approve → Execute → Verify → Record) streamlines cash discipline across 20–100 clients using QBO, Ramp, and Plaid.

1. **Multi-Client Console**: Portfolio dashboard with red/yellow/green buffer status and client drill-downs.
2. **Client Cash Check**:
   - **Digest Tab**: Shows 7-14 day runway buffer using Plaid balances, Ramp/QBO bills, QBO/CSV A/R, and payroll dates.
   - **Hygiene Tab**: Flags critical data issues (e.g., stale Plaid feeds, missing Ramp vendors) for approval reliability, with QBO/Ramp links.
   - **Console Tab**: Approves/releases Ramp bills with guardrail checks (e.g., “buffer &gt; 14 days”).
3. **Execution & Proof**: Releases payments via Ramp API, verifies via webhooks, posts BillPayments and audit notes to QBO.
4. **Friday Cash Digest**: Per-client and firm-wide summary (web/email) of cash position, decisions, and variances, justifying retainers.
5. **Concierge Fallbacks**: CSV A/R imports and QBO/Ramp deep links for non-API workflows.

**Cash Discipline Model**:

- **Guardrails**: No approvals if buffer &lt; 14 days or $10k; prioritize payroll/rent/taxes; pay on Tue/Thu.
- **Cadence**: Weekly cash checks; monthly hygiene closes for data reliability.
- **Horizons**: 7-14 day control horizon for liquidity; 30-60 day advisory horizon for trends (post-MVP).
- **KPIs**:
  - **Runway Buffer Days**: Tracks 7-14 day cushion, saving 30+ min/client/week.
  - **Approval Hit Rate**: Targets 50%+ bills via RowCol, streamlining approvals.
  - **A/R Friction Index**: Informs runway via CSV, supporting 70% pilot buy-in.
  - **Drift Rate**: Detects variances, eliminating spreadsheets by week 3.

**Engineering Priorities**:

- **Core Loop**: Webhook → Approve (Ramp API) → Verify (webhooks/Plaid) → Record (QBO).
- **Digest**: Plaid balances, QBO/Ramp A/P, CSV A/R → buffer calculation.
- **Console UI**: Bills tray, buffer impact, Approve/Hold buttons.
- **Hygiene**: Lightweight scans for issue counts (e.g., stale feeds).
- **Multi-Client View**: Scalable red/yellow/green dashboard.

**Time Savings**: 5–10 minutes/client vs. 30–45 minutes.\
**Client Value**: Digests and audit trails prove proactive governance.

## Why Choose RowCol

RowCol delivers multi-client cash discipline, unifying rails for scalable advisory, unlike single-client or compliance-focused tools.

**For Advisors**:

- **Scalability**: One console for 20–100 clients.
- **Efficiency**: 5–10 minutes/client vs. 30–45 minutes.
- **Stewardship**: Friday Cash Digests position you as a financial steward, strengthening $5k-$10k/month retainers.
- **Trust**: Guardrails ensure safe approvals; audit trails prove compliance.

**For Clients**:

- **Trust**: Digests show proactive governance.
- **Clarity**: Simple, branded summaries.
- **Reliability**: Essentials (payroll, rent) always clear.

### Advisor and Client Experience (Backstage → Front stage)
RowCol supports advisors “backstage” to reduce surprises and speeds decisions, and presents clear stewardship “front stage” to clients.

- Backstage (Advisor): Pre‑flight readiness (cross‑rail hygiene), variance watchlist, guardrail‑enforced decisions, and WWW (Who/What/When) capture; forecast freshness/confidence to extend decision distance.
- Front stage (Client): Weekly Digest or equivalent deliverable with a Pre‑flight badge, top variances, updated runway, and WWW next‑steps; short, branded, and audit‑linked.
- Modes: Active (live cash call), Managed (as‑needed), Silent (auto digest) all use the same four surfaces (Digest, Hygiene, Console, Forecast) without new modules.

**Competitive Landscape**:

| Tool | Multi-Client View | Cash Discipline | A/P Governance | A/R Insights | Client Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **QBO** | ❌ | Basic | Basic | Basic | ❌ |
| **Ramp/Relay** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (Execution) | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Float/Fathom** | ❌ | Basic | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (Reports) |
| **Centime** | ❌ | ✅ (Single-company) | ✅ (Internal) | ✅ (Internal) | ❌ |
| **Mid-Market Suites** | ❌ | ✅ (Single-client) | ✅ (AP/AR) | ✅ | ❌ |
| **RowCol** | ✅ | ✅ (Multi-rail) | ✅ (Orchestration) | ✅ (Multi-rail) | ✅ (Digests, Audits) |

**Centime Comparison**: Centime validates the cash discipline market ($50+/user/month) but serves single companies internally. RowCol delivers the same discipline across multiple client companies through multi-rail orchestration.

**Why Tools Fall Short**:

- **QBO**: Ledger for compliance, not real-time governance.
- **Ramp/Relay**: Single-client A/P execution, no portfolio view.
- **Float/Fathom**: Forecasting, not short-horizon discipline.
- **Centime**: Single-company internal tool, no multi-client orchestration.
- **Mid-Market Suites**: Single-client automation, no multi-client advisory.

Let’s walk it step-by-step, from day-to-day bookkeeping all the way through month-end close and assembling the close binder accountants rely on.
I’ll frame this in the order most small-to-mid-size accounting teams work, but note that larger firms or enterprise setups add more automation, controls, and reviews.

1. Bookkeeping Foundations (Daily / Weekly)

This is the “transaction capture” stage — without good data here, the close will always be messy.

A. Accounts Payable (AP)

Collect bills/invoices (email, portals, scanned docs)

Enter vendor bills into QBO / Xero / ERP, tagging expense category, job/project, and department if needed

Schedule payments (check, ACH, credit card, bill pay)

Reconcile vendor statements to catch missed bills or duplicates

B. Accounts Receivable (AR)

Create invoices for goods/services delivered

Send invoices and follow up on overdue accounts

Apply customer payments from bank feed, lockbox, or merchant services

Manage credit memos and write-offs

C. Bank & Credit Card Transactions

Daily or weekly bank feed matching

Manual entry for non-feed accounts

Record transfers and intercompany moves

D. Inventory Management (if applicable)

Track receipts, sales, adjustments, shrinkage

Perform spot counts for high-value or fast-moving SKUs

E. Payroll & Related Liabilities

Run payroll (weekly/biweekly)

Post payroll journal entries

Remit taxes and benefit payments

2. Pre-Close Review (Last Week of Month)

The goal here is to make sure all inputs are in and nothing material is missing.

Checklist:

All vendor bills received & entered

All customer invoices sent

All cash receipts posted

All bank and credit card feeds up to date

All manual journals posted (e.g., loan interest, depreciation, accruals)

Preliminary P&L and balance sheet run for review

3. Month-End Close (Close Management)

This is where you lock the period — the “close” — so the books for that month won’t change.

A. Reconciliations

Bank accounts (including petty cash)

Credit cards

Loans and lines of credit

Payroll clearing accounts

Inventory subledger to GL

AP and AR aging to subledger

B. Adjusting Entries

Accruals (expenses incurred, not yet billed)

Deferrals (prepaid expenses, unearned revenue)

Depreciation & amortization

Inventory adjustments

Foreign currency revaluation (if applicable)

C. Review & Approvals

Compare to prior months / budget / forecast

Investigate variances

Confirm all high-risk accounts are accurate (cash, AR, AP, fixed assets, payroll, taxes)

4. Close Binder Assembly

The “close binder” is essentially an audit-ready, self-contained package of all month-end work — it’s your evidence trail.

Typical Close Binder Structure (by tab/folder):

Close Checklist – signed/dated by preparer & reviewer

Trial Balance & Financial Statements – final P&L, balance sheet, cash flow

Reconciliations – for each account, with supporting bank/loan/credit statements

Subledger Reports – AP aging, AR aging, inventory reports, fixed asset register

Journal Entries – with documentation & approvals

Supporting Schedules – accrual calcs, prepaids, depreciation schedules, etc.

Compliance Docs – tax filings, payroll returns, government remittances

Variance Analysis – explanations for significant changes from prior month

Management Commentary – optional narrative for internal/external stakeholders

5. Best Practices for Scaling

Use a close management tool (FloQast, BlackLine, Vena, or even Asana/Trello in SMBs)

Automate bank feeds and AP/AR ingestion to reduce manual entry

Standardize reconciliations with templates (Excel or GSheet-based)

Assign clear preparer/reviewer roles

Maintain version control on the binder (date-stamped PDFs or shared drive folders)

If you want, I can also map this process into a Cloudfirms/RowCol-style automation flow, showing exactly where automation and human review intersect — so you’d know which steps to build into software first vs. keep manual while scaling. That’s where the close binder really becomes a structured, software-driven artifact instead of a manual chore.

Do you want me to do that automation mapping next?

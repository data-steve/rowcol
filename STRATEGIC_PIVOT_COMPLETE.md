## ðŸ“‹ What Changed in Code

### **Nothing Yet!**
- All code remains the same
- Architecture already multi-tenant ready (`business_id` scoping)
- Phase 3 will add Firm/FirmStaff models
- No breaking changes to existing code

### **What Will Change (Phase 3)**
```python
# NEW: Add these models
class Firm(Base): ...
class FirmStaff(Base): ...

# UPDATED: Add firm_id (nullable)
class Business(Base):
    firm_id: int | None  # NULL for direct owner

# NEW: Firm-level routes
GET /firms/{firm_id}/clients
GET /firms/{firm_id}/dashboard
```

---

## ðŸš€ Development Workflow

### **Current Branch**: `feat/firm-first`

**Working on Phase 3**:
```bash
# You're already on feat/firm-first
git status  # Check current state
git add .   # Stage changes
git commit -m "feat: add Firm and FirmStaff models"
git push    # Push to origin/feat/firm-first
```

**When Phase 3 Complete**:
```bash
# Merge to main when multi-tenant foundation working
git checkout main
git merge feat/firm-first --no-ff
git push origin main
```

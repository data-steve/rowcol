"""
Runway Reserves Package - Cash Reserve Management for Runway Product

This package contains Oodaloo-specific reserve management logic that orchestrates
QBO account data to provide cash runway reserve functionality.

Note: This is runway/ (product orchestration), not domains/ (QBO primitives)
because reserve earmarking is unique Oodaloo business logic, not a QBO capability.

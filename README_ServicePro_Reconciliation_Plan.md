# ServicePro MVP: Bundled AR Matching & Job Cost Reconciliation

## üéØ **Problem Statement**

Service contractors face complex revenue recognition challenges that make manual reconciliation necessary:

1. **Multi-Job Revenue Timing**: Jobs span multiple months but payments come in lump sums
2. **Mixed Payment Sources**: Jobber invoices ‚Üí Stripe payments ‚Üí QBO deposits (with fees)
3. **Job Cost Allocation**: Labor/materials across multiple jobs need proper allocation
4. **Period Mismatches**: Work performed in Month A, invoiced in Month B, paid in Month C
5. **Partial Payments**: Customers pay portions of invoices across different periods
6. **Multiple Teams**: Different crews working different jobs with overlapping timelines

## üèóÔ∏è **The Realistic Test Scenario**

### **Company**: "Elite Landscaping Services"
- **Teams**: 3 crews (Team A, B, C)
- **Time Period**: March 1-31, 2024 (with spillover into April)
- **Payment Processing**: Jobber ‚Üí Stripe ‚Üí QBO

### **Jobs Portfolio**:

#### **Job #1: "Suburban Mall Renovation"** 
- **Timeline**: Feb 15 - Mar 20 (spans 2 months)
- **Team**: Team A (primary) + Team B (support)
- **Total Contract**: $15,000
- **Payment Terms**: 50% upfront, 50% on completion
- **Complexity**: 
  - Upfront payment received Feb 28 ($7,500)
  - Final payment delayed to April 3 ($7,500)
  - March work: $6,200 in labor + $1,800 in materials
  - **RevRec Challenge**: How much revenue to recognize in March?

#### **Job #2: "Residential Backyard Project"**
- **Timeline**: Mar 5 - Mar 12 (single period)
- **Team**: Team B
- **Total Contract**: $3,200
- **Payment Terms**: Net 30
- **Complexity**:
  - Work completed Mar 12
  - Invoice sent Mar 15
  - Customer paid Mar 28 ($3,200)
  - **RevRec Challenge**: Clean recognition, but Stripe fees need allocation

#### **Job #3: "Commercial Property Maintenance"**
- **Timeline**: Mar 1 - Ongoing (recurring)
- **Team**: Team C
- **Total Contract**: $1,200/month
- **Payment Terms**: Monthly in advance
- **Complexity**:
  - March payment received Mar 1 ($1,200)
  - Additional emergency work Mar 18 ($800)
  - Emergency work invoiced Mar 20, paid Apr 5
  - **RevRec Challenge**: Recurring vs. one-time revenue recognition

#### **Job #4: "Multi-Property HOA Contract"**
- **Timeline**: Mar 10 - Mar 25
- **Team**: All teams (rotating)
- **Total Contract**: $8,500
- **Payment Terms**: 30% upfront, 70% in 3 installments
- **Complexity**:
  - Upfront payment: $2,550 (received Mar 8)
  - Installment 1: $1,983 (due Mar 20, paid Mar 22)
  - Installment 2: $1,983 (due Apr 5, paid Apr 7)
  - Installment 3: $1,984 (due Apr 20, pending)
  - **RevRec Challenge**: Percentage-of-completion vs. milestone recognition

### **Payment Flow Complications**:

#### **Stripe Processing Fees**:
- Standard rate: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Job #1 Final: $7,500 ‚Üí Fee: $247.80 ‚Üí Net: $7,252.20
- Job #2: $3,200 ‚Üí Fee: $122.80 ‚Üí Net: $3,077.20
- Job #3 Recurring: $1,200 ‚Üí Fee: $65.10 ‚Üí Net: $1,134.90
- Job #3 Emergency: $800 ‚Üí Fee: $53.50 ‚Üí Net: $746.50
- Job #4 Installments: Various fees totaling ~$180

#### **Bank Deposit Timing**:
- Stripe payouts: T+2 business days
- Weekend delays affect month-end cutoffs
- Some March work payments hit QBO in April

#### **Expense Allocation Challenges**:
- **Shared Materials**: $2,400 in mulch used across Jobs #1, #2, #4
- **Equipment Rental**: $600 excavator rental (3 days) used on Jobs #1 and #4
- **Labor Overlap**: Team B worked on both Job #1 and Job #2 same week
- **Vehicle Expenses**: $380 in fuel across all jobs (no clear allocation)

## üßÆ **The Math That Doesn't Line Up**

### **March Revenue Recognition Scenarios**:

#### **Scenario A: Cash Basis (Simple)**
```
Total Cash Received in March: $12,367.10
- Job #1 Upfront (Feb payment): $0
- Job #2 Payment: $3,077.20  
- Job #3 Recurring: $1,134.90
- Job #4 Upfront: $2,550.00
- Job #4 Install 1: $1,983.00 (net of fees)

Problem: Doesn't match work performed in March
```

#### **Scenario B: Accrual Basis (Complex)**
```
March Revenue Should Be: $16,850
- Job #1: $8,000 (March portion of total work)
- Job #2: $3,200 (completed in March)
- Job #3: $1,200 (recurring) + $800 (emergency)
- Job #4: $3,650 (March portion based on % completion)

Problem: Cash received doesn't match, creates AR/timing issues
```

#### **Scenario C: Percentage of Completion (Most Accurate)**
```
Complex calculation based on:
- Job #1: 60% complete in March = $9,000 revenue
- Job #2: 100% complete = $3,200 revenue  
- Job #3: $1,200 + 100% of emergency = $2,000 revenue
- Job #4: 43% complete = $3,655 revenue

Total March Revenue: $17,855
Problem: Requires detailed job progress tracking
```

## üéØ **Our Solution Approach**

### **Phase 1: Data Generation & Integration**

#### **1.1 Jobber Test Data Creation**
```python
# Create realistic Jobber data
jobs = [
    {
        "id": "JOB_001_MALL_RENO",
        "title": "Suburban Mall Renovation",
        "customer": "Westfield Properties LLC",
        "start_date": "2024-02-15",
        "end_date": "2024-03-20",
        "total_value": 15000.00,
        "status": "completed",
        "line_items": [
            {"description": "Excavation & Grading", "amount": 4500.00, "date": "2024-02-20"},
            {"description": "Landscape Installation", "amount": 7200.00, "date": "2024-03-05"},

            {"description": "Final Cleanup", "amount": 1000.00, "date": "2024-03-20"}
        ]
    }
    # ... additional jobs
]

# Create invoices with realistic timing delays
invoices = [
    {
        "job_id": "JOB_001_MALL_RENO",
        "invoice_date": "2024-02-25",
        "due_date": "2024-02-25",  # 50% upfront
        "amount": 7500.00,

        "paid_date": "2024-04-03"  # Late payment!
    }
    # ... additional invoices
]
```

#### **1.2 Stripe Payment Simulation**
```python
# Simulate Stripe payments with realistic fees and timing
stripe_payments = [
    {
        "charge_id": "ch_3N2K1L2eZvKYlo2C0X4q5r6s",
        "amount": 750000,  # $7,500 in cents
        "fee": 24780,      # 2.9% + $0.30
        "net": 725220,     # Net amount
        "created": "2024-02-28T15:30:00Z",
        "payout_date": "2024-03-01",  # T+2 business days
        "description": "Suburban Mall Renovation - 50% Deposit",
        "metadata": {
            "jobber_invoice_id": "INV_001_MALL_50PCT",
            "job_id": "JOB_001_MALL_RENO"
        }
    }
    # ... additional payments with various complications
]
```

#### **1.3 QBO Integration Complexity**
```python
# QBO entries that need reconciliation
qbo_transactions = [
    # Bank deposits (net of Stripe fees)
    {
        "type": "Deposit",
        "date": "2024-03-01",
        "amount": 7252.20,

        "memo": "Stripe payout - multiple jobs",
        "class": None  # No job allocation yet!
    },
    
    # Stripe fee expenses

        "vendor": "Stripe",
        "class": None  # Needs allocation to jobs
    },
    
    # Job expenses that need allocation

### **Continuous Validation**:
```python
class ReconciliationValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.validation_rules = [
            self.validate_period_totals,
            self.validate_fee_allocations,
            self.validate_revenue_recognition,
            self.validate_cash_flow_timing
        ]
    
    def validate_reconciliation(self, reconciliation_result):
        """
        Run comprehensive validation checks
        """
        validation_results = []
        
        for rule in self.validation_rules:
            result = rule(reconciliation_result)
            validation_results.append(result)
        
        overall_confidence = sum(r["confidence"] for r in validation_results) / len(validation_results)
        
        return {
            "overall_confidence": overall_confidence,
            "individual_results": validation_results,
            "requires_human_review": overall_confidence < 0.90
        }
```
